Hamilton and others, that sensation is simply a function of the intellect? It might with equal reason be maintained that there is no real difference between any other two organs of the body, because in the ovum they are developed out of one homogeneous tissue or common germinal mass.\u201d\u2020 According to Von Baer's law, it seems that while in the lower animals sense and intelligence are fused into one, in the higher they become differentiated, each having a separate seat. When Dr. Bastian then, contends, with the metaphysicians, for the identity of sense and intelligence, he seems to be reversing the method of evolution, and going back to the medley out of which well-defined organs with improved functions were evolved. He would make us believe that as the sense-ganglia become more defined and eliminate the rudiments of intelligence, they assume a lower function than they had before, one not to be distinguished in kind from that of the excito-motor system previously differentiated. Is this likely? As to the impossibility of discriminating sense from intelligence there are the following facts indicating the contrary. Physiology shows that the external object of the many must be revealed in a seat that is not at the periphery; but such an object is not an idea or notion; therefore, there is a marked distinction between an external object in sense and an idea of one in intellect. A sense-object may be common to two-distinct sets of ideas, as when it is now interpreted to be a ghost, now the stump of a tree. A sense-object is antecedent to an ideal object, for the latter only exists as a representation of the former.

What is known at first hand is known as it is, for if you say not as it is; but as it is not, you imply that it is not known at first hand, but through something which does not even represent it, which is absurd. Therefore, as sense and intelligence must be known at first hand, and, as thus known, are distinguishable from each other in many respects, pre-eminently, the one as the sphere of objects at first hand, the other at second hand; the one as pertaining to the organic ego, the other to the non-organic ego\u2014each must be known as it is, not as it is not.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"1","prism.number":"16","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"407","prism.endingPage":"407","prism.copyright":"1870 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/001407b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/001407b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/001407b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/001407b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Sensation and Perception","citation_volume":"1","citation_issue":"16","citation_publication_date":"1870/02","citation_firstpage":"407","citation_lastpage":"407","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/001407b0","DOI":"10.1038/001407b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/001407b0","description":"HAVING in the Journal of Mental Science tried to show how Sensation and Intellect are distinguished from each other, allow me to state, in regard to Dr. Bastian's views on this head, that Dr. Lockhart Clarke, after a careful review of what has been written on Sensation, rejects Sir W.

Therefore, as sense and intelligence must be known at first hand, and, as thus known, are distinguishable from each other in many respects, pre-eminently, the one as the sphere of objects at first hand, the other at second hand; the one as pertaining to the organic ego, the other to the non-organic ego\u2014each must be known as it is, not as it is not.","dc.creator":["DAVIES, W.

In examining certain pools of water in the East, notorious for their poisonous qualities at certain seasons of the year, I was aware of intermittent risings of vast quantities of bubbles.

Poultry and cage birds showed particular distress by the noise and fluttering which they made. The temperature, which on the previous Tuesday night had fallen as low as 17\u00b0, suddenly changed, and the minimum of Friday night was 41\u00b0. Saturday morning was remarkably warm; the black bulb thermometer in vacuo reading 92\u00b0. The barometer showed no unsteadiness, but had been gradually rising for some days previously.

The vibrations were apparently horizontal, and probably in a direction from N. to S., lasting about three or four seconds. Poultry and cage birds showed particular distress by the noise and fluttering which they made. The temperature, which on the previous Tuesday night had fallen as low as 17\u00b0, suddenly changed, and the minimum of Friday night was 41\u00b0. Saturday morning was remarkably warm; the black bulb thermometer in vacuo reading 92\u00b0. The barometer showed no unsteadiness, but had been gradually rising for some days previously. The shocks seems to have been felt from the south of Scotland as far as the north of Derbyshire, much the same account having been received from each locality.","dc.creator":["FAWCETT, THOMAS"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["FAWCETT, THOMAS"],"citation_author_institution":["Blencowe, Penrith"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Earthquake","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Earthquake&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"003447a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

As a member of the Porcupine expeditions of 1869 and 1870, I had nearly eight weeks' constant daily experience in the examination of samples of abyssal water thus obtained, and I believe that I was the first to adapt the gas analysis apparatus of the late Prof. W.

My object in writing now is to point out that if there were such an escape of gaseous ingredients as is indicated above, the abyssal water would be so saturated with them at the ordinary atmospheric pressure (i.e. after the sample was removed from the water cylinder in the laboratory), that the least elevation of temperature would be sufficient to cause a further quantity to be given off. This, however, never was the case, since I invariably noticed that there was no appearance of bubbles of gas, until the water had been heated above 120\u00b0 Fahr., and frequently still hotter. I may add that the only samples of water which appeared saturated with gaseous ingredients were those taken at the surface, after several hours of strong wind. I must confess that after giving a good deal of thought to the subject, and conversing with friends whose knowledge of physics is far greater than mine, who agree with my view of the matter, I am unable to see any reason why we should expect to find any greater quantity of gaseous ingredients in abyssal than in surface water. No doubt, if the excess were there the enormous pressure would retain it, but where is the source of the supply of the supposed excess? I have never seen a satisfactory answer to this question. The solvent is exposed to excessive pressure, but the gases to be dissolved in it are not, unless there is any evolution of gas at those depths. It is probable that this abyssal water was at some point in its circulation near the surface, when an interchange would take place between some of its dissolved carbonic acid and the oxygen of the atmosphere.

The rare butterfly, by some curious perversity, is certain to he seen when the net is not at hand. How, under such circumstances, is the butterfly to be caught? I reply, wait till it settles, and then pick it up. Perhaps most of your readers will reply \u201cAbsurd, no butterfly will sit to be caught in that way.\u201d Try and see. Whenever the butterfly settles you may walk quickly up to within a short distance from it; the distance will depend on the nature of the butterfly. Arrived at a short distance from the butterfly, the motion must now be slow and even, and as the hand is slowly and steadily advanced towards the butterfly, it will take little or no notice of it, and may be easily picked up with the fingers. In Italy this spring I picked up in this manner both varieties of swallow-tails, as many as five when walking one afternoon. I have also caught in this way, whites, red admirals, painted ladies, peacocks, and many other smaller varieties. This manner of catching butterflies does look suspiciously like the old story of catching birds by putting salt on their tails. Before anyone condemns it, I ask him to give it a fair trial, and I have no doubt he will be astonished at his success. The only thing to guard against is any jerkiness in your motions. All your motions when near the butterfly must be slow and regular. Perhaps the butterfly may not sit long enough for you to approach it by such slow motions. If the butterfly does rise take care not to change your slow and steady motions, and it will take no notice of you, and will often settle again within a few inches of your hand. Often the butterfly takes no notice of you; at other times it seems sensible of danger, but generally contents itself by folding its wings as close as possible, as if to escape notice. When the wings are in this position the butterfly is caught with least damage to its plumage. But in some cases the wings are open. When that is the case I have sometimes folded, the wings before picking them up, in order to save the plumage, so tame are they under this treatment. At first I thought it was necessary to approach the butterfly from behind, and keep out of sight as much as possible, but this I find, though an advantage, is not essential. Of course I do not advocate this plan of catching butterflies when a net can be got, as it is much slower and not so certain. Yet it has its advantages. You get the butterfly without breaking its wings or ruffling a feather, and if not a good specimen you can let it away unhurt.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"6","prism.number":"140","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"181","prism.endingPage":"182","prism.copyright":"1872 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/006181c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/006181c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/006181c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/006181c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"To Entomologists","citation_volume":"6","citation_issue":"140","citation_publication_date":"1872/07","citation_firstpage":"181","citation_lastpage":"182","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/006181c0","DOI":"10.1038/006181c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/006181c0","description":"How often is it that the entomologist has to regret the want of his net?

Many years ago I was on a mail-coach, and as soon as we came to a public-house, the coachman pulled up for the fraction of a second. He did so when we came to a second public-house, and I then asked him the reason. He pointed to the off-hand wheeler, and said that she had been long completely blind, and she would stop at every place on the road at which she had before stopped. He had found by experience that less time was wasted by pulling up his team than by trying to drive her past the place, for she was contented with a momentary stop. After this I watched her, and it was evident that she knew exactly, before the coachman began to pull up the other horses, every public-house on the road, for she had at some time stopped at all. I think there can be little doubt that this mare recognised all these houses by her sense of smell. With respect to cats, so many cases have been recorded of their returning from a considerable distance to their homes, after having been carried away shut up in baskets, that I can hardly disbelieve them, though these stories are disbelieved by some persons. Now, as far as I have observed, cats do not possess a very acute sense of smell, and they seem to discover their prey by eyesight and by hearing. This leads me to mention another trifling fact: I sent a riding-horse by railway from Kent vi\u00e2. Yarmouth, to Freshwater Bay, in the Isle of Wight. On the first day that I rode eastward, my horse, when I turned to go home, was very unwilling to return towards his stable, and he several times turned round. This led me to make repeated trials, and every time that I slackened the reins, he turned sharply round and began to trot to the eastward by a little north, which was nearly in the direction of his home in Kent. I had ridden this horse daily for several years, and he had never before behaved in this manner. My impression was that he somehow knew the direction whence he had been brought. I should state that the last stage from Yarmouth to Freshwater is almost due south, and along this road he had been ridden by my groom; but he never once showed any wish to return in this direction. I had purchased this horse several years before from a gentleman in my own neighbourhood, who had possessed him for a considerable time. Nevertheless it is possible, though far from probable, that the horse may have been born in the Isle of Wight. Even if we grant to animals a sense of the points of the compass, of which there is no evidence, how can we account, for instance, for the turtles which formerly congregated in multitudes, only at one season of the year, on the shores of the Isle of Ascension, finding their way to that speck of land in the midst of the great Atlantic Ocean?","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"7","prism.number":"176","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"360","prism.endingPage":"360","prism.copyright":"1873 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/007360c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/007360c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/007360c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/007360c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Perception in the Lower Animals","citation_volume":"7","citation_issue":"176","citation_publication_date":"1873/03","citation_firstpage":"360","citation_lastpage":"360","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/007360c0","DOI":"10.1038/007360c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/007360c0","description":"As several persons seem interested in Mr. Wallace's suggestion that animals find their way home by recognising the odour of the places which they have passed whilst shut up, you may perhaps think the following little fact worth giving. Many years ago I was on a mail-coach, and as soon as we came to a public-house, the coachman pulled up for the fraction of a second. He did so when we came to a second public-house, and I then asked him the reason. He pointed to the off-hand wheeler, and said that she had been long completely blind, and she would stop at every place on the road at which she had before stopped. He had found by experience that less time was wasted by pulling up his team than by trying to drive her past the place, for she was contented with a momentary stop. After this I watched her, and it was evident that she knew exactly, before the coachman began to pull up the other horses, every public-house on the road, for she had at some time stopped at all. I think there can be little doubt that this mare recognised all these houses by her sense of smell. With respect to cats, so many cases have been recorded of their returning from a considerable distance to their homes, after having been carried away shut up in baskets, that I can hardly disbelieve them, though these stories are disbelieved by some persons. Now, as far as I have observed, cats do not possess a very acute sense of smell, and they seem to discover their prey by eyesight and by hearing. This leads me to mention another trifling fact: I sent a riding-horse by railway from Kent vi\u00e2. Yarmouth, to Freshwater Bay, in the Isle of Wight. On the first day that I rode eastward, my horse, when I turned to go home, was very unwilling to return towards his stable, and he several times turned round.

The apparatus used were a gold-leaf electroscope, and one of the ordinary table insulators long used in this University, of which the following is a description. A A is a hollow cylinder of brass, the lower part of which can be readily detached, replaced, and fixed in position by a bayonet-joint. The cylinder is supported at the top by the glass rod S, which passes through a circular opening in the bottom of the cylinder and is fixed to the sole plate C. In the lower part is placed a circular canal of lead containing a number of pieces of pumice stone p p, which for insulating purposes are moistened with a few drops of strong sulphuric acid.

The apparatus used were a gold-leaf electroscope, and one of the ordinary table insulators long used in this University, of which the following is a description. A A is a hollow cylinder of brass, the lower part of which can be readily detached, replaced, and fixed in position by a bayonet-joint. The cylinder is supported at the top by the glass rod S, which passes through a circular opening in the bottom of the cylinder and is fixed to the sole plate C. In the lower part is placed a circular canal of lead containing a number of pieces of pumice stone p p, which for insulating purposes are moistened with a few drops of strong sulphuric acid. On the previous evening the pumice p p was moistened with a few drops of water, the cylinder closed and left till morning. The experiment was then performed thus The gold leaves of the electroscope were connected with A A by a fine wire and a charge communicated; the gold leaves at first repelled each other, but almost immediately collapsed.

As the last two were subsequent to the great display of 1833, the meteors seen were noticed only in consequence of their being specially looked for; and as the number conformable to the radiant of the Leonids is not given, there may be some doubt whether those observed really belonged to the November stream. The former displays occurred before the periodicity of such phenomena had been suspected, and the number of meteors would seem to have been considerable. As the shower of 1787 preceded by twelve years the great meteoric fall witnessed in South America by Humboldt, the group from which it was derived had passed beyond the orbit of Saturn at the time of the latter display. The phenomena of 1818, 1820, 1822, and 1823 indicate that, as in the case of the major group, which passed its descending node between 1865 and 1870, the meteoroids are extended over a considerable arc of their orbit.

In view of the fact that the shower from this cluster was due between 1851 and 1855, the following extract from the writer's note-book is not without interest:\u2014","dc.creator":["KIRKWOOD, DANIEL"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["KIRKWOOD, DANIEL"],"citation_author_institution":["Bloomington, U.S.A."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Meteors of November 14","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Meteors of November 14&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"012107c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In the first place the late Prof. Jukes was by no means so strongly in favour of the Cambrian age of these rocks as Prof. Hull states. Prof. Jukes' words, in Potter's (not Porter's) \u201cHistory of Charnwood Forest\u201d are as follows:\u2014\u201cIt is therefore uncertain whether they (the rocks of Charnwood) belong to the Devonian, Silurian, or Cambrian systems, the probability only being in favour of the latter.\u201d Secondly, the Cambrian of Sedgwick includes a great deal more than the Cambrian of the Geological Survey, and therefore there is not the perfect unanimity between these two authorities that Prof. Hull's remarks would lead us to believe. Thirdly, if lithological resemblance is to go for anything, it may be used directly against the Cambrian age of the rocks. On the western side of the forest we find sheets of crystalline rock and beds of highly altered conglomerates and breccias, which have a suggestive likeness to the lava flows and ash beds of the green slate and porphyry series of the Lake District. I don't say the resemblance proves anything, but it is worth quite as much as the similarity between the slates on the east side of the forest and the slates of Llanberis. Mr. Bonney has also called attention to the fact that the strike of the Charnwood Forest rocks is the same as that of the Volcanic Series in the Lake Country, when that group is last seen. Again, it is far from certain that the rocks of Charnwood Forest are all of the same age.

In the first place the late Prof. Jukes was by no means so strongly in favour of the Cambrian age of these rocks as Prof. Hull states. Prof. Jukes' words, in Potter's (not Porter's) \u201cHistory of Charnwood Forest\u201d are as follows:\u2014\u201cIt is therefore uncertain whether they (the rocks of Charnwood) belong to the Devonian, Silurian, or Cambrian systems, the probability only being in favour of the latter.\u201d Secondly, the Cambrian of Sedgwick includes a great deal more than the Cambrian of the Geological Survey, and therefore there is not the perfect unanimity between these two authorities that Prof. Hull's remarks would lead us to believe. Thirdly, if lithological resemblance is to go for anything, it may be used directly against the Cambrian age of the rocks. On the western side of the forest we find sheets of crystalline rock and beds of highly altered conglomerates and breccias, which have a suggestive likeness to the lava flows and ash beds of the green slate and porphyry series of the Lake District. I don't say the resemblance proves anything, but it is worth quite as much as the similarity between the slates on the east side of the forest and the slates of Llanberis. Mr. Bonney has also called attention to the fact that the strike of the Charnwood Forest rocks is the same as that of the Volcanic Series in the Lake Country, when that group is last seen. Again, it is far from certain that the rocks of Charnwood Forest are all of the same age. I recollect seeing many years ago some sections (of which I am afraid I have kept no record) that seemed to show that some of the bosses of Dioritic rock near Markfield were older than the slates that surrounded them. If this be so, perhaps these crystalline hills may be the projecting points of a nucleus of similar rock that underlies the whole area, and which may be Laurentian in age. The rocks are not gneiss, but I know of no reason why the equivalents of the rocks of the Hebrides must be gneiss all the world over; they are, however, rich in hornblende, and so are the Hebridian rocks.

It is not true that \u201cof all the 360 fellowships in the various colleges only five are held by persons (exclusive of professors) who have been elected to them in consideration of their attainments in physical science.\u201d At the present moment no less than six fellowships are being held by biologists, viz., at Exeter, two; at Magdalen, two; at Pembroke, one; and at Ch. Cb., one; and two fellowships at Merton, one at Brasenose, one at C. C. C., and two at Ch. Ch., are tenable for physics or chemistry solely. It is true that one Merton fellowship and the one at Corpus is at the moment vacant, but this does not affect the question.

M. J. Berkeley in NATURE (vol. xviii. p. 15) that the late \u201cDr. Thomas Thomson was so fortunate, after three times ascending the Sow of Atholl, as to rediscover the long lost Menziesia crulea\u201d. I doubt if it was ever lost, certainly it has not been long lost. I find, on looking over my Herbarium, that my specimen was collected August 6, 1867; since then I have heard of it having been found by others. I saw several plants which I left, and I have little doubt that some of them are there still. Fortunately the preservation of the plant is due to the following circumstances:\u20141st.

I doubt if it was ever lost, certainly it has not been long lost. I find, on looking over my Herbarium, that my specimen was collected August 6, 1867; since then I have heard of it having been found by others. I saw several plants which I left, and I have little doubt that some of them are there still. Fortunately the preservation of the plant is due to the following circumstances:\u20141st.

The initial objection to Mr. Garnett's scheme appears to me to be that the work he suggests will really be as large as the original catalogue, and, in fact, the same work in a new order. Even were it possible to get the money (probably little short of 10,000l.), the question would naturally arise whether or no the result was likely to be worth this great outlay. Moreover, the plan proposed by Mr. Garnett would not meet the great difficulty of compilation, which consists in the getting together of papers treating of identical subjects, but written with various titles by different persons.

The initial objection to Mr. Garnett's scheme appears to me to be that the work he suggests will really be as large as the original catalogue, and, in fact, the same work in a new order. Even were it possible to get the money (probably little short of 10,000l.), the question would naturally arise whether or no the result was likely to be worth this great outlay. Moreover, the plan proposed by Mr. Garnett would not meet the great difficulty of compilation, which consists in the getting together of papers treating of identical subjects, but written with various titles by different persons. This would make it necessary to employ experts in each subject, and also a general practical editor for the whole, under whose eye all entries must pass.

Now in Great Britain, the mountainous districts excepted, the mean temperature of the coldest month is nowhere lower than 36\u00b0.","dc.creator":["WOEIKOF, A."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["WOEIKOF, A."],"citation_author_institution":["St. Petersburg"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"[Letters to Editor]","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;[Letters to Editor]&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"023243e0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The following alterations will make the account of the Japanese brewing process correct:\u2014\u201cSak\u00e9 (rice-beer) is prepared as follows: a mixture of steamed rice, k\u00f6ji, and water is allowed to remain in shallow tubs at a low temperature (0\u00b0 \u2013 5\u00b0 C.) until quite liquid; it is then heated\u2026\u201d. Not using malt as we do in our breweries, the Japanese have discovered for themselves a means of rendering the rice-grains diastatic with allowing the embryo to germinate. This is effected by exposing the softened rice-grains to the action of dry steam, by which treatment the starch is gelatinised; when cold the spores of a mould are caused to grow over the surface of the rice, the mycelium being formed at the expense of the starch, and heat being liberated together with the usual products of combustion. The albuminoid matter of the rice, which previously was for the most part insoluble in water, is, after the growth of the mycelium, found to be almost completely soluble, and the solution possesses diastatic properties resembling those of malt extract. The main point in which it differs from the latter is in its superior hydrating power, for, unlike malt-extract, the solution of k\u00f6ji very quickly converts maltose into dextrose. This material (k\u00f6ji) is then used instead of malt in the mashing process, the sugar formed from the rice-starch under the influence of the dissolved k\u00f6ji being dextrose, which is further fermented by the accidental introduction from the atmosphere of the germs of a species of yeast. The change induced in the character of the albuminoid matter under the influence of the growing mould is remarkable, and, I think, novel, and the interest of the observations I have made lies in the support they give to the opinion that the diastatic property is connected with the degree of solubility of the albuminoid matter, and in the fact that this may result as well from the growth of an organism foreign to the grain as from the germination of the embryo itself.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"24","prism.number":"622","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"509","prism.endingPage":"510","prism.copyright":"1881 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/024509d0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/024509d0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/024509d0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/024509d0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Brewing in Japan","citation_volume":"24","citation_issue":"622","citation_publication_date":"1881/09","citation_firstpage":"509","citation_lastpage":"510","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/024509d0","DOI":"10.1038/024509d0","citation_doi":"10.1038/024509d0","description":"WILL you permit me to point out art error which has crept into the report of my paper on \u201cBrewing in Japan\u201d in last week's NATURE, p. 468.

It appeared to start from the barren region of the Lynx, bordering on the Twins, a little to the east, and above Pollux, and travelled in the direction of Canis Minor. It was much brighter than any object then shining, though Jupiter and Sirius were both visible, and left a train of light behind which appeared to be granular, of a dull red colour, and fusiform in shape.

This, no doubt, is an account of the very remarkable advance of the Buerbr\u0153 (br\u0153 is Norsk for glacier) near Odde, on the S\u00f6rfj\u00f6rd. I visited the place in 1874, and the recent ploughing up of a considerable bit of the valley by the vast irresistible ice-plough was very striking, while the glacier itself was very beautiful. My object, however, is to repeat a strange piece of folk-lore, which tends to show that in this particular spot, the advance of the glacier must have been long-continued. The legend was told me by Asbj\u00f6rn Olsen, a very intelligent guide at Odde, who speaks good English. The tale was that long ago the Buer valley extended far into the mountains, and was full of farms and cultivation. It had also a village, a church, and a pastor. One winter night when a fearful storm was threatened, three Finns (i.e. Lapps) entered the valley and begged shelter in vain of the inhabitants. At last they asked the priest, and he too refused. Then the wrath of the heathen wizards was raised, and they solemnly cursed the valley and doomed it to destruction by the crawling power of the ice, until the glacier reached the lake below. The Lapps were seen no more, but on their disappearing the snow began to fall. The winter was awful. The glacier approached by awful steps, and by degrees engulfed the cursed valley and farms. Nor is the curse yet exhausted, for the glacier creeps down the valley each year, and has yet a mile to go before it reaches its destination in the lake above Odde. I am no judge of folk-lore, but this weird tale seemed to me a genuine piece of it, and not invented for the occasion, as Olsen gave it half jokingly as the tradition of the district. The farmer who owns the remnant of the doomed valley, wanted then to sell it, as he saw his acres swallowed up each year, but no one will buy. If this tale be genuine, it points to a prolonged advance of the Folgefond, which has led to the tale of the Lapps' curse. Those interested in ice-action will see a fine example of the \u201cTysseustrengene,\u201d or polished stone fells of Norway, between Odde and the splendid Skj\u00e6gadals (or Ringedal's) Fos. The rocks are so polished by the ancient ice that a path is made over them by putting rough fir trees down to give a foothold. The ice-polishing on the Grimsel Pass in Switzerland, is a mere nothing to these \u201cTyssenstrengene.\u201d","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"25","prism.number":"646","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"460","prism.endingPage":"461","prism.copyright":"1882 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/025460b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/025460b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/025460b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/025460b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Advance of Norwegian Glaciers","citation_volume":"25","citation_issue":"646","citation_publication_date":"1882/03","citation_firstpage":"460","citation_lastpage":"461","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/025460b0","DOI":"10.1038/025460b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/025460b0","description":"IN NATURE, vol. xxv. p. 449, you quote an account from Naturen of the changes of movement observed in Norwegian glaciers.

In the first instance he knows she is going where he may go, and he is on his feet barking with joy as soon as she appears. If she has the bonnet on, he knows it to be church, or a visit to friends in the country, where he cannot go, and, like the \u201celdest oyster\u201d (I quote from memory), he \u201cwinks his eye, and shakes his hoary head.\u201d If drawings of hat and bonnet were made, he would know them at once.","dc.creator":["WORTLEY, H.

C. Normann of the Danish Royal Navy, in command of the ship Fylla, during her recent scientific voyage to Greenland, a distinguished officer and an eminent authority in Arctic matters. The article is long\u2014too long for my powers of translation\u2014but, with the friendly help of a Danish young gentleman of this University, I have mastered it, and find it exceedingly entertaining. It treats of the island which, as already announced in these columns (vol. xxxi. p. 37) and elsewhere, is said to have been lately thrust up, as other islands have before been known to be upthrust (at least temporarily) in that volcanic neighbourhood. According to the statement of Mr. Consul Paterson (loc. cit.) it is said to have been first observed by the lighthouse-keeper at Reykjanes on July 29; and it would seem that news of its apparition speedily reached Reykjavik; but unfortunately, says Capt. Normann, there was then no ship there available to make search for it. Rather less than a month later, however, the Dupleix and Romanche, of the French navy, arrived at that port, and the commander of the former, animated with the laudable desire to determine the position of the new island, and if possible to effect a landing upon it, resolved to do so in the course of his homeward voyage, and, with that intent, set out after a short delay. To the surprise of all at Reykjavik, he, as he subsequently informed the French Consul there, could find no trace of the object of his search on August 24. On the departure of the Dupleix, however, the commander of the Romanche dispatched two of his officers, equipped with proper instruments, by land to Reykjanes, thence to take the bearings of the new island. On August 26 they undoubtedly saw an island corresponding in position with what they expected to see, and reported accordingly to Reykjavik, where Capt. Normann's Fylla had arrived on the 25th, on her homeward voyage. The Danish commander, equally enthusiastic in the cause of scientific discovery, accordingly left Reykjavik early on the morning of the 27th, and soon after mid-day his ship was off Reykjanes, whence he pursued a course along the northern side of the bank from which the Fowlskerries emerge, seeing nothing of the new island, it is true, but that time the weather was thick. However, he passed cautiously (as well became a navigator in water liable to volcanic upthrusts) along the whole range, and even beyond the furthest of the emerged skerries\u2014the Geirfugladr\u00e1ngr or Grenadeerhuen, when it began to grow dark, and also to blow. Next morning he turned back, running still along the northern side of the bank. It was clear and beautiful weather, and the rock just named, as well as Eldey or Mels\u00e6kken, the innermost of the range, stood out in bright sunshine. Breakers marked the position of the old Geirfuglask\u00e9r, which sank beneath the waves in 1830, and the neighbouring coast of Iceland, as well as the inland fells, was plainly visible, but nothing in the shape of a \u201cnew\u201d island was to be seen. So he came back to about midway between the Meal-sack and Reykjanes\u2014the lead giving a depth of eighty fathoms of water. Thence, thinking that after all there might be some mistake in the reported position of the island, he put his ship's head about, and ran along the southern side of the bank.

Hooker by experiments on young and old rhododendron leaves, and on leaves of other plants, for my botany classes, and have been surprised at the great difference in the weight of mineral-ash left by equal weights of calcined leaves from the same plant, according as they were culled at the beginning or the end of the season.","dc.creator":["IRVING, ALEXANDER"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["IRVING, ALEXANDER"],"citation_author_institution":["Wellington College, Wokingham"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Fall of Autumnal Foliage","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Fall of Autumnal Foliage&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"031504a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The plate of silica was formed in the floated vessel. A similar result may be obtained by placing in a wide test-tube a portion of basic silicate. Taking care that the upper portion of the tube is quite free from adhering silicate, the dilute acid should be poured on to the surface of the silicate without disturbing it. After a few hours the silica is eliminated in a crystalloid form.","dc.creator":["ROWNEY, THOMAS"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["ROWNEY, THOMAS"],"citation_author_institution":["Hull"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Tabasheer","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Tabasheer&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"036077a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

He says that \u201cP0 must be determined so as to make L\u2032 and L\u2033 as nearly as possible identical with L.\u201d If the object is only to deduce a correct value of L by combining equations (15) and (16), this condition is certainly not necessary. For if we substitute from (17) in (15) and (16), and take the mean of the values of L\u2032 and L\u2033, we get by a very roundabout process the same value of L as we should have obtained without using P0 at all.

I quote from pp. 49 and 50 some paragraphs to show the connection between views then held and those at which I have recently arrived.","dc.creator":["ABBE, CLEVELAND"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["ABBE, CLEVELAND"],"citation_author_institution":["Washington"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Meteoritic Theory","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Meteoritic Theory&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"040126a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Hence, despite the \u201cworld of weight upon its shoulders,\u201d Mr. Thompson concluded that \u201cthe presence of this oyster affords interesting evidence that the Hyas lived several years after attaining its full growth.\u201d Probably the larv\u00e6 of the oysters, and of the Ascidians also, happened to alight upon the crabs at the end of their free-swimming existence, although six or seven years seems to me to be a remarkably long age for a Hyas.","dc.creator":["GARSTANG, WALTER"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["GARSTANG, WALTER"],"citation_author_institution":["Plymouth"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Foreign Substances attached to Crabs","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Foreign Substances attached to Crabs&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"041585a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Mr. Bakewell, in 1829, \u201cwas informed by Mr. Forsyth, the proprietor of the Pavilion Hotel on the Canada side, that during his residence of forty years the Falls had receded forty yards\u201d (American Journal of Science, May 1857, p. 85). It is well-known that Sir Chas. Lyell, at the time of his visit to the Falls, came to the conclusion that the rate of recession was not over one foot a year. He based his estimate upon the statement of his guide, that between 1815 and 1841 the American Fall had receded forty feet. Modern investigators, basing their calculations on the surveys of 1842, 1875, and 1883, estimate the recession of the Canadian Fall at from three to five feet per year, and the age of the gorge from seven to ten thousand years (see Mr. Wesson's article in NATURE, vol. xxxii. p. 229; and Prof. Wright's \u201cIce Age in North America,\u201d p. 452 seq.). A recent American publication, \u201cThe Journal of William Maclay,\u201d a member of the Senate in the first Congress, 1789\u201391, brings to light the result of local observation of the recession of the Falls for the thirty years previous to the beginning of Forsyth's observations, which have generally been cited as the earliest. The passage in Maclay's journal reads:\u2014 \u201cFebruary 1st [1790].\u2026. Mr. Ellicott's accounts of Niagara Falls are amazing indeed. I communicated to him my scheme of an attempt to account for the age of the world, or at least to fix the period when the water began to cut the ledge of rock over which it falls. The distance from the present pitch to where the Falls originally were, is now seven miles. For this space a tremendous channel is cut in a solid limestone rock, in all parts one hundred and fifty feet deep, but near two hundred and fifty at the mouth, or part where the attrition began. People who have known the place since Sir William Johnson took possession of it, about thirty years ago, give out that there is an attrition of twenty feet in that time. Now, if 20 feet = 30 years = 7 miles, or 36,960 feet; answer, 55,440 years\u201d In view of the fact that since 1842 the rate of recession has varied widely, this earlier testimony, so far as it can he relied upon, is especially interesting. It is possible that the observation related to the American Falls, as did that of Sir Chas. Lyell's guide; but there is nothing to indicate it, except that this is about the present rate of recession of the American Fall as calculated by Mr. Wesson. The intelligent attitude and fertile scientific suggestion of Senator Maclay are very remarkable in 1790. It will be remembered that Hutton's \u201cTheory of the Earth\u201d was not published separately till 1795. Maclay seems to have anticipated men of science by many years in proposing to use the recession of the gorge as a scale for measuring geological time. Perhaps even more noteworthy is the unconcern with which he sets down his conclusion that the gorge was over 55,000 years old, at a time when geology was still confined by the narrow and seemingly impassable limits of traditional Biblical chronology. Maclay's informant, Ellicott, was a Government surveyor, and, according to the account of his life in Appleton's \u201cCyclop\u00e6dia of American Biography,\u201d \u201che was selected by Washington in 1789 to survey the land lying between Pennsylvania and Lake Erie, and during that year he made the first accurate measurement of the Niagara river from lake to lake, with the height of the falls and the descent of the rapids.\u201d This early survey seems entirely unknown to geologists, who all refer to Hall's of 1842 as the first. Ellicott was a man of considerable attainments, a professor in West Point from 1808 to 1820, and the correspondent of Europem learned societies. He left some published writings, and works still in manuscript. Cannot the data of this survey of a century ago be found? If it proved a careful one, it would double the period of scientific observation of the recession of the gorge, and increase the certainty of any generalization. The map of Evershed's survey of 1883 was published in Science, vol. v. p. 398. In NATURE, vol. xxxii. p. 244, Mr. Garbett quotes some interesting observations from the Gentleman's Magazine, January 1751, from Kalm's description of the Falls as seen shortly before. Mr. Garbett tries to identify an island that Kalm mentions as intersecting the Falls as Luna Islet. This would give a definite point for calculation.

Mr. Bakewell, in 1829, \u201cwas informed by Mr. Forsyth, the proprietor of the Pavilion Hotel on the Canada side, that during his residence of forty years the Falls had receded forty yards\u201d (American Journal of Science, May 1857, p. 85). It is well-known that Sir Chas. Lyell, at the time of his visit to the Falls, came to the conclusion that the rate of recession was not over one foot a year. He based his estimate upon the statement of his guide, that between 1815 and 1841 the American Fall had receded forty feet. Modern investigators, basing their calculations on the surveys of 1842, 1875, and 1883, estimate the recession of the Canadian Fall at from three to five feet per year, and the age of the gorge from seven to ten thousand years (see Mr. Wesson's article in NATURE, vol. xxxii. p. 229; and Prof. Wright's \u201cIce Age in North America,\u201d p. 452 seq.). A recent American publication, \u201cThe Journal of William Maclay,\u201d a member of the Senate in the first Congress, 1789\u201391, brings to light the result of local observation of the recession of the Falls for the thirty years previous to the beginning of Forsyth's observations, which have generally been cited as the earliest. The passage in Maclay's journal reads:\u2014 \u201cFebruary 1st [1790].\u2026. Mr. Ellicott's accounts of Niagara Falls are amazing indeed. I communicated to him my scheme of an attempt to account for the age of the world, or at least to fix the period when the water began to cut the ledge of rock over which it falls. The distance from the present pitch to where the Falls originally were, is now seven miles. For this space a tremendous channel is cut in a solid limestone rock, in all parts one hundred and fifty feet deep, but near two hundred and fifty at the mouth, or part where the attrition began. People who have known the place since Sir William Johnson took possession of it, about thirty years ago, give out that there is an attrition of twenty feet in that time. Now, if 20 feet = 30 years = 7 miles, or 36,960 feet; answer, 55,440 years\u201d In view of the fact that since 1842 the rate of recession has varied widely, this earlier testimony, so far as it can he relied upon, is especially interesting. It is possible that the observation related to the American Falls, as did that of Sir Chas. Lyell's guide; but there is nothing to indicate it, except that this is about the present rate of recession of the American Fall as calculated by Mr. Wesson. The intelligent attitude and fertile scientific suggestion of Senator Maclay are very remarkable in 1790. It will be remembered that Hutton's \u201cTheory of the Earth\u201d was not published separately till 1795. Maclay seems to have anticipated men of science by many years in proposing to use the recession of the gorge as a scale for measuring geological time. Perhaps even more noteworthy is the unconcern with which he sets down his conclusion that the gorge was over 55,000 years old, at a time when geology was still confined by the narrow and seemingly impassable limits of traditional Biblical chronology. Maclay's informant, Ellicott, was a Government surveyor, and, according to the account of his life in Appleton's \u201cCyclop\u00e6dia of American Biography,\u201d \u201che was selected by Washington in 1789 to survey the land lying between Pennsylvania and Lake Erie, and during that year he made the first accurate measurement of the Niagara river from lake to lake, with the height of the falls and the descent of the rapids.\u201d This early survey seems entirely unknown to geologists, who all refer to Hall's of 1842 as the first. Ellicott was a man of considerable attainments, a professor in West Point from 1808 to 1820, and the correspondent of Europem learned societies. He left some published writings, and works still in manuscript. Cannot the data of this survey of a century ago be found? If it proved a careful one, it would double the period of scientific observation of the recession of the gorge, and increase the certainty of any generalization. The map of Evershed's survey of 1883 was published in Science, vol. v. p. 398. In NATURE, vol. xxxii. p. 244, Mr. Garbett quotes some interesting observations from the Gentleman's Magazine, January 1751, from Kalm's description of the Falls as seen shortly before. Mr. Garbett tries to identify an island that Kalm mentions as intersecting the Falls as Luna Islet. This would give a definite point for calculation. It seems to me that an attempt to test Mr. Garbett's conjecture by the Evershed map must show that it is untenable. If I have understood him, and correctly measured in accordance with his suggestions, the recession of the Canadian Falls will have been about half a mile in the 133 years, or about twenty feet a year. Notwithstanding Kalm's small dimensions, I think he meant Goat Island, for he says the island lies parallel with the river, and Luna Islet prolonged would lie almost at right angles to the river at its lower end.","dc.creator":["BOURNE, EDWARD G."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["BOURNE, EDWARD G."],"citation_author_institution":["Adelbert College, Cleveland"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Recession of the Niagara Gorge","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Recession of the Niagara Gorge&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"043516e0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In the year 1836, the brothers William and Edward Weber represented, in their celebrated work on the \u201cMechanism of the Human Locomotive Apparatus,\u201d a person in the act of walking, in those attitudes which, according to theoretical calculation, must occur successively during one step. Thence a strange fact became apparent. At the beginning and end of each step, while the body rests for a short time on both feet, the pictures agree perfectly with the ordinary way in which painters have been accustomed to represent walking persons.

In the year 1836, the brothers William and Edward Weber represented, in their celebrated work on the \u201cMechanism of the Human Locomotive Apparatus,\u201d a person in the act of walking, in those attitudes which, according to theoretical calculation, must occur successively during one step. Thence a strange fact became apparent. At the beginning and end of each step, while the body rests for a short time on both feet, the pictures agree perfectly with the ordinary way in which painters have been accustomed to represent walking persons. But during the middle of the step, while one foot is swinging past the other, the effect is highly eccentric, not to say ludicrous; the individual appears to be stumbling over his own feet like a tipsy fiddler, and nobody had ever been seen walking in such a way.

I may perhaps be allowed, however, to take advantage of the courtesy of the Editor of NATURE, and to say a few words in elucidation of the thesis I very imperfectly set forth in my paper, a thesis based entirely on observation and induction.","dc.creator":["MORGAN, C.

B. H. HAS, I am glad to see, criticised effectively the syllabus of Elementary Biology put forth by the Conjoint Board (NATURE, vol. xlvii. p. 530). A less fortunate course of study could hardly have been devised. The students who take the course include a number whose previous education, energy and ambition are not sufficient to encourage them to attempt a university course, and the average quality is therefore not very good. They work through a number of unicellular types, which give no training for the hands, though they are no doubt useful in other ways. Then come Hydra and the Leech. Hydra is of course a good subject. The Leech is not instructive to a student who has no knowledge of similar animals, and the untrained man cannot possibly dissect it for himself. The rest of the course consists of parasitic worms and certain generalities. The parasitic worms commonly have the nervous system, heart, and sometimes even the alimentary canal absent or poorly developed, while the reproductive organs are of extraordinary complexity.

B. H. HAS, I am glad to see, criticised effectively the syllabus of Elementary Biology put forth by the Conjoint Board (NATURE, vol. xlvii. p. 530). A less fortunate course of study could hardly have been devised. The students who take the course include a number whose previous education, energy and ambition are not sufficient to encourage them to attempt a university course, and the average quality is therefore not very good. They work through a number of unicellular types, which give no training for the hands, though they are no doubt useful in other ways. Then come Hydra and the Leech. Hydra is of course a good subject. The Leech is not instructive to a student who has no knowledge of similar animals, and the untrained man cannot possibly dissect it for himself. The rest of the course consists of parasitic worms and certain generalities. The parasitic worms commonly have the nervous system, heart, and sometimes even the alimentary canal absent or poorly developed, while the reproductive organs are of extraordinary complexity. From these the student has mainly to derive his notions of the plans of structure which are found among animals. Such a course of study looks practical, but it is almost pure waste of time. It does not teach the student to dissect, nor does it introduce him to those problems of Nature which are most accessible to a beginner.

The parent birds were watching from the outside, and during the whole time occupied by the old male in feeding their progeny were also trying to introduce food through the bars.

What I did incautiously say was, in effect, that the time allowance for the cutting of the gorge would be about 7000 years if the rate of the cutting were uniform, but that there was good reason to believe the rate had not been even approximately uniform.","dc.creator":["GILBERT, G.

Notwithstanding that it is in these stars of Group VI. we should most expect the bright lines on Dr. Brester's theory, no bright lines have been recorded in variable stars belonging to the group; that is, there is no visible chemical luminescence.","dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Variability of Red Stars","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Variability of Red Stars&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"053316a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The most serious difficulty which the reviewer advances against the new view, seems to be that Dalton, in his manuscript lecture to the Royal Institution in 1810, states that, as a consequence of an idea respecting elastic fluids which occurred to him in 1805, \u201cit became an object to determine the relative sizes and weights, together with the relative number of atoms in a given volume\u201d; whereas in one of his note-books, under date September 6, 1803, a table of atomic weights is given. The reviewer says:\u2014 \u201cThe authors notice this conflict of statement, but get rid of it by assuming 1805 to be a clerical error for 1803.\u201d In regard to these conflicting dates, I beg to draw attention to a passage which appears to have escaped the vigilance both of the authors and of the reviewer, and which seems to tell strongly in favour of the clerical error theory. In the preface to Part I. of Dalton's \u201cNew System of Chemical Philosophy\u201d (1808), the author, writing of himself, says:\u2014 \u201cIn 1803, he was gradually led to those primary laws, which seem to obtain in regard to heat, and to chemical combinations, and which it is the object of the present work to exhibit and elucidate. A brief outline of them was first publicly given the ensuing winter in a course of lectures on natural philosophy, at the Royal Institution in London, and was left for publication in the journals of the Institution; but he is not informed whether that was done.\u201d I do not think there is any room for reasonable doubt that this passage refers, amongst other things, to the same idea as that stated in the manuscript lecture to have occurred to Dalton in 1805. In any case the date 1803 is definitely settled by the sentence referring to the lectures at the Royal Institution, since we know that Dalton's lectures were begun there on December 22, 1803 (compare Roscoe and Harden's \u201cNew View, &c,\u201d p. 61).

Parkin, in his letter in your issue of November 4, \u00f2n \u201cA Bee's Movements in a Room.\u201d In the year 1893, the humming-bird hawk moth was particularly common here. On one or two occasions, driving out in a little trap, with a Shetland pony, whose head-gear was ornamented with pyramidal blue rosettes, one of these beautiful insects would fly straight at one of the rosettes, and hover over it for a few seconds, though the pony was going at a trot.

On one or two occasions, driving out in a little trap, with a Shetland pony, whose head-gear was ornamented with pyramidal blue rosettes, one of these beautiful insects would fly straight at one of the rosettes, and hover over it for a few seconds, though the pony was going at a trot.

The \u201cfalling star\u201d was about equal in brightness to Sirius. When first it attracted my attention it would be just below the cluster \u201cComa Berenices.\u201d So slowly was it falling that I first mistook it for the fixed star Arcturus, the resemblance being probably increased by its colour, which was reddish. It slowly dropped vertically downwards, its brilliancy keeping constant; it left no trail. Its line of descent would make a small angle with the line \u03b4\u03b2 Leonis.

When first it attracted my attention it would be just below the cluster \u201cComa Berenices.\u201d So slowly was it falling that I first mistook it for the fixed star Arcturus, the resemblance being probably increased by its colour, which was reddish. It slowly dropped vertically downwards, its brilliancy keeping constant; it left no trail. Its line of descent would make a small angle with the line \u03b4\u03b2 Leonis.

We found that when the var. lacticolor (flavofasciata) was crossed with the type it behaved as a Mendelian recessive, disappearing entirely in generation F1. When two heterozygotes were mated together, var. lacticolor reappeared, but only in the female sex, roughly half the females and all the males being typical. When a heterozygous male was mated with lacticolor female, the variety appeared in both sexes in the offspring, viz. in about half the males and half the females. When, however, a lacticolor male so produced was paired with a heterozygous female, we found that all the males were typical and all the females lacticolor. This result was given in our paper with some hesitation, since it was founded on a rather small number of specimens (29 O, 11 O+ ), but this year it is amply confirmed.

It did not seem to me probable that the effects could be accounted for by unequal diffusivity of the positive and negative ions, or by centrifugal separation, nor does it seem necessary to assume, with Prof. Zeeman, that the magnetic effects are due to electrons participating in the vortical motion. Since that time I have recalled that, so far as definite evidence goes, all luminous vapours giving a line spectrum, and therefore capable of showing the Zeeman effect, are positively charged. A flame coloured with sodium or lithium vapour and placed between two condenser plates is attracted by the negative plate. This fact was used by Lenard to determine the velocity of the positive ions. As shown by Riecke and Stark (Phys. Zeit., v., 537, 1904), if a sodium or lithium salt is placed on the kathode of a long spark the coloured vapour remains in that neighbourhood; if placed on the anode it is at once projected across the entire length of the gap.

It did not seem to me probable that the effects could be accounted for by unequal diffusivity of the positive and negative ions, or by centrifugal separation, nor does it seem necessary to assume, with Prof. Zeeman, that the magnetic effects are due to electrons participating in the vortical motion. Since that time I have recalled that, so far as definite evidence goes, all luminous vapours giving a line spectrum, and therefore capable of showing the Zeeman effect, are positively charged. A flame coloured with sodium or lithium vapour and placed between two condenser plates is attracted by the negative plate. This fact was used by Lenard to determine the velocity of the positive ions. As shown by Riecke and Stark (Phys. Zeit., v., 537, 1904), if a sodium or lithium salt is placed on the kathode of a long spark the coloured vapour remains in that neighbourhood; if placed on the anode it is at once projected across the entire length of the gap. Hemsalech (Comptes rendus, cxlii., 2, 1906) proved spectroscopically that the metallic vapour in the spark is projected solely from the positive electrode. As shown by Stark (Ann. der Phys., xiv., 529, 1904), that part of the luminous vapour in a mercury arc which gives a band spectrum is unaffected by an electric field, while that part which gives a line spectrum is positively charged. The canal and anode rays are likewise examples of positively charged carriers giving a line spectrum.","dc.creator":["LEWIS, E.

There are cloudy stri\u00e6 in it, which would prove fatal for optical purposes, but would be even sought for if it had been intended as a decorative boss; while the grinding of the \u2018convex\u2019 surface is not smooth but produced by a large number of irregular facets, making the curvature quite unfit for optical purposes.

His figure represents a brain with approximately symmetrical right and left hemispheres, so far as these are viewed from the hinder or occipital aspect. If, then, the anatomical parts occupy corresponding positions on the two sides, he has solved the problem of how to reconstruct the Piltdown skull so as to obtain a considerably smaller brain than I had postulated. I have made a tracing of his reconstruction in order to fill in with some details the exact relationship of parts represented by his drawing. It will be seen he has obtained symmetry by the most simple means.

His figure represents a brain with approximately symmetrical right and left hemispheres, so far as these are viewed from the hinder or occipital aspect. If, then, the anatomical parts occupy corresponding positions on the two sides, he has solved the problem of how to reconstruct the Piltdown skull so as to obtain a considerably smaller brain than I had postulated. I have made a tracing of his reconstruction in order to fill in with some details the exact relationship of parts represented by his drawing. It will be seen he has obtained symmetry by the most simple means. In the original brain cast the right hemisphere of the brain measured only 555 cubic centimetres, the left half 645 c.c.; this difference of 90 c.c. referred only to the hinder part of each hemisphere.

And 2020 is now seen as possible for what was unimaginable until recently, the practical quantum computer. Another imminent revolution is \u2018smart dust\u2019: tiny sensors that monitor everything everywhere. Stephen Muggleton welcomes the data bonanza generated by automation, but argues that science is an essentially human activity and that progress brings its dangers. Hugo-award-winning novelist Vernor Vinge ponders a future we can barely imagine. Alexander Szalay and Jim Gray argue that we are nearing the limit of what one research group can achieve in data handling. Roger Brent and Jehoshuah Bruck ask what computer science can contribute to biological research and Ian Foster reviews the two-way relationship between science and computing.","dc.creator":["Szalay, Alexander","Gray, Jim"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["Towards 2020 Science (Microsoft, 2006); \n                    http://research.microsoft.com/towards2020science"],"citation_author":["Szalay, Alexander","Gray, Jim"],"citation_author_institution":["the Department of Physics and Astronomy, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA","Microsoft Research, San Francisco, USA"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Science in an exponential world","twitter:description":"Nature - This week&#39;s forward-looking science and computing special takes 2020 as the iconic future date.

The protein p53 is an important mediator of the DNA damage response and tumour suppression in vertebrates. In general, these two attributes are thought to be causally linked: p53 suppresses tumours by responding to DNA damage or genome abnormalities in tumour cells and triggering growth arrest or apoptosis. Now using a reversibly switchable endogenous p53 mouse model, Christophorou et al. show that the pathological p53-induced response to irradiation is irrelevant to p53-mediated suppression of tumours induced by that irradiation. Conversely, restoring p53 at later times avoids the pathological effects of irradiation but provides much of the tumour suppression. These data suggest that the DNA damage response and tumour suppression are unlinked activities of p53, each induced by distinct signals. A similar conclusion is drawn from a separate experiment, the absence of the tumour suppressor protein ARF was found to abolish the extra cancer-protective activity of an additional copy of p53 in mice. Again, this suggests that oncogenic signalling is critical for triggering protection by p53, whereas activation of p53 as a result of DNA damage has a lesser impact on the final development of tumours. In News and Views, Anton Berns looks at the implications of these findings for models of p53 activity. The tumour-suppressor protein p53 provides the most important genetic defence against cancer1 and is activated in response to DNA damage and to oncogenic signalling, both of which occur almost universally in malignant tumours. But the relative contribution of these two pathways in inducing p53-dependent protection against cancer is unclear. Here we show that p53-dependent protection against cancer is lost in mice that have been genetically manipulated so that their p53 is activated in response to DNA damage but not to oncogenic signalling. We conclude that oncogenic signalling is the critical event that elicits p53-dependent protection and that the DNA-damage stimulus is less important.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.publicationDate":"2006-09-13","prism.volume":"443","prism.number":"7108","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"159","prism.endingPage":"159","prism.copyright":"2006 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/443159a","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/443159a","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/443159a.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/443159a","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Policing of oncogene activity by p53","citation_volume":"443","citation_issue":"7108","citation_publication_date":"2006/09","citation_online_date":"2006/09/13","citation_firstpage":"159","citation_lastpage":"159","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/443159a","DOI":"10.1038/443159a","citation_doi":"10.1038/443159a","description":"Oncogenes, rather than DNA damage, may provide the key signal to p53 to trigger tumour suppression.

We conclude that oncogenic signalling is the critical event that elicits p53-dependent protection and that the DNA-damage stimulus is less important.","dc.creator":["Efeyan, Alejo","Garcia-Cao, Isabel","Herranz, Daniel","Velasco-Miguel, Susana","Serrano, Manuel"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Oncogene; citation_author=SL Harris, AJ Levine; citation_volume=24; citation_publication_date=2005; citation_pages=2899-2908; citation_doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1208615; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Cell; citation_author=T Kamijo; citation_volume=91; citation_publication_date=1997; citation_pages=649-659; citation_doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80452-3; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=EMBO J.; citation_author=I Garcia-Cao; citation_volume=21; citation_publication_date=2002; citation_pages=6225-6235; citation_doi=10.1093/emboj/cdf595; citation_id=CR3","citation_journal_title=EMBO J.; citation_author=FJ Stott; citation_volume=17; citation_publication_date=1998; citation_pages=5001-5014; citation_doi=10.1093/emboj/17.17.5001; citation_id=CR4","citation_journal_title=Cancer Res.; citation_author=T Kamijo; citation_volume=59; citation_publication_date=1999; citation_pages=2464-2469; citation_id=CR5","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_author=I Palmero, C Pantoja, M Serrano; citation_volume=395; citation_publication_date=1998; citation_pages=125-126; citation_doi=10.1038/25870; citation_id=CR6","citation_journal_title=Genes Dev.; citation_author=F Zindy; citation_volume=12; citation_publication_date=1998; citation_pages=2424-2433; citation_doi=10.1101/gad.12.15.2424; citation_id=CR7","citation_journal_title=Genes Dev.; citation_author=E de Stanchina; citation_volume=12; citation_publication_date=1998; citation_pages=2434-2442; citation_doi=10.1101/gad.12.15.2434; citation_id=CR8","citation_journal_title=Mutat.

As metabolic rate limits production as an individual grows, dM/dt \u221d M3/4. Incorporating interspecific variation in resource allocation to wood density, we derive a universal growth law that quantitatively fits data for a large sample of tropical tree species with diverse life histories. Combined with evolutionary life-history theory1, the growth law also predicts several qualitative features of tree demography and reproduction. This framework also provides a general quantitative answer to why relative growth rate (1/M)(dM/df) decreases with increasing plant size (\u221dM-1/4) and how it varies with differing allocation strategies5,6,7,8.","dc.creator":["Enquist, Brian J.","West, Geoffrey B.","Charnov, Eric L.","Brown, James H."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_title=Life History Invariants: Some Explorations of Symmetry in Evolutionary Ecology; citation_publication_date=1993; citation_id=CR1; citation_author=EL Charnov","citation_title=The Evolution of Life Histories; citation_publication_date=1992; citation_id=CR2; citation_author=SC Stearns","citation_title=The Tropical Rain Forest 2nd edn; citation_publication_date=1996; citation_id=CR3; citation_author=PW Richards","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=Ancient trees in Amazonia.; citation_author=JQ Chambers, N Higuchi, JP Schimel; citation_volume=391; citation_publication_date=1998; citation_pages=135-136; citation_id=CR4","citation_journal_title=J.

Light can be described by its intensity, spectral distribution and polarization, and normally a visual system analyses these independently to extract the maximum amount of information1.

Our results indicate that the primary mechanism by which fng establishes a compartment border is by positioning a stripe of Notch activation, but also that fng may exert additional influences on compartmentalization.","dc.creator":["Rauskolb, Cordelia","Correia, Trudy","Irvine, Kenneth D."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=Developmental compartmentalization of the wing disk of Drosophila.; citation_author=A Garc\u00eda-Bellido, P Ripoll, G Morata; citation_volume=245; citation_publication_date=1973; citation_pages=251-253; citation_doi=10.1038/245251a0; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Cell; citation_title=Morphogens, compartments, and pattern: lessons from Drosophila?; citation_author=PA Lawrence, G Struhl; citation_volume=85; citation_publication_date=1996; citation_pages=951-961; citation_doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81297-0; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=Segmentation in the chick embryo hindbrain is defined by cell lineage restrictions.; citation_author=S Fraser, R Keynes, A Lumsden; citation_volume=344; citation_publication_date=1990; citation_pages=431-435; citation_doi=10.1038/344431a0; citation_id=CR3","citation_journal_title=Development; citation_title=Dorso-ventral ectodermal compartments and origin of apical ectodermal ridge in developing chick limb.; citation_author=M Altabel, JDW Clarke, C Tickle; citation_volume=124; citation_publication_date=1997; citation_pages=4547-4556; citation_id=CR4","citation_journal_title=Development; citation_title=The dorsoventral polarity of the presumptive limb is determined by signals produced by the somites and by the alteral somatopleure.; citation_author=JL Michaud, F Lapointe, NM Douarin; citation_volume=124; citation_publication_date=1997; citation_pages=1453-1463; citation_id=CR5","citation_journal_title=Genes.

However, the performance of all-silicon devices is limited by intrinsic material properties. In particular, the absence of linear electro-optic effects in silicon renders the integration of energy-efficient photonic\u2013electronic interfaces challenging. Silicon\u2013organic hybrid (SOH) integration can overcome these limitations by combining nanophotonic silicon waveguides with organic cladding materials, thereby offering the prospect of designing optical properties by molecular engineering. In this paper, we demonstrate an SOH Mach\u2013Zehnder modulator with unprecedented efficiency: the 1-mm-long device consumes only 0.7\u2005fJ\u2005bit\u22121 to generate a 12.5\u2005Gbit\u2005s\u22121 data stream with a bit-error ratio below the threshold for hard-decision forward-error correction. This power consumption represents the lowest value demonstrated for a non-resonant Mach\u2013Zehnder modulator in any material system. It is enabled by a novel class of organic electro-optic materials that are designed for high chromophore density and enhanced molecular orientation. The device features an electro-optic coefficient of r33\u2248180\u2005pm\u2005V\u22121 and can be operated at data rates of up to 40\u2005Gbit\u2005s\u22121. Scientists have demonstrated a hybrid silicon\u2013organic electro-optic modulator that consumes just 0.7\u2005fJ of energy per processed data bit. Such highly energy efficient optical modulators are needed for the short-reach, high-density data interconnects of the future. The 1-mm-long device is based on a Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer design and is compatible with data rates of up to 40 Gbit s\u22121. The modulator realizes a subfemtojoule efficiency by employing silicon slot waveguides filled with a highly nonlinear organic material called DLD164, which has a very large electro-optic coefficient of 180 pm V\u22121. The researchers, who are from Europe, the USA and China, claim that the modulator has the lowest power consumption demonstrated to date for a non-resonant Mach\u2013Zehnder modulator realized in any material system.","prism.publicationName":"Light: Science & Applications","prism.publicationDate":"2015-02-27","prism.volume":"4","prism.number":"2","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"e255","prism.endingPage":"e255","prism.copyright":"2015 The Author(s)","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201528","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2015.28","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201528.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201528","citation_journal_title":"Light: Science & Applications","citation_journal_abbrev":"Light Sci Appl","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"2047-7538","citation_title":"Femtojoule electro-optic modulation using a silicon\u2013organic hybrid device","citation_volume":"4","citation_issue":"2","citation_publication_date":"2015/02","citation_online_date":"2015/02/27","citation_firstpage":"e255","citation_lastpage":"e255","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2015.28","DOI":"10.1038/lsa.2015.28","citation_doi":"10.1038/lsa.2015.28","description":"Energy-efficient electro-optic modulators are at the heart of short-reach optical interconnects, and silicon photonics is considered the leading technology for realizing such devices. However, the performance of all-silicon devices is limited by intrinsic material properties.

Increasing the optical power at the receiver is the best way to improve all link performance metrics including gain, noise figure and dynamic range. Even though lasers can produce and photodetectors can receive optical powers on the order of a Watt or more, the power-handling capability of optical fibres is orders-of-magnitude lower. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate the use of few-mode fibres to bridge this power-handling gap, exploiting their unique features of small acousto-optic effective area, large effective areas of optical modes, as well as orthogonality and walk-off among spatial modes. Using specially designed few-mode fibres, we demonstrate order-of-magnitude improvements in link performances for single-channel and multiplexed transmission. This work represents the first step in few-mode microwave photonics. The spatial degrees of freedom can also offer other functionalities such as large, tunable delays based on modal dispersion and wavelength-independent lossless signal combining, which are indispensable in microwave photonics. The use of few-mode, large-core optical fibres can dramatically enhance the performance of microwave photonics communications. Fibre-optic microwave photonic links have become a basic building block for microwave photonics, but their performance is currently limited by the power-handling capability of optical fibres. Now, Guifang Li at the University of Central Florida in the USA and co-workers reduced nonlinear crosstalk in a wavelength-division multiplexed communications link by 30 decibels through employing a 20-kilometre-long few-mode fibre. Using a few-mode fibre allowed them to overcome the optical nonlinearity problems that tend to plague single-mode fibres when large optical signal powers are used. Experiments using single-wavelength channels also showed improved transmission. Future research will explore using few-mode fibres to perform functions such as tunable delay and wavelength-independent lossless signal combination.","prism.publicationName":"Light: Science & Applications","prism.publicationDate":"2017-02-21","prism.volume":"6","prism.number":"8","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"e17021","prism.endingPage":"e17021","prism.copyright":"2017 The Author(s)","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201721","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2017.21","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201721.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201721","citation_journal_title":"Light: Science & Applications","citation_journal_abbrev":"Light Sci Appl","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"2047-7538","citation_title":"Few-mode fibre-optic microwave photonic links","citation_volume":"6","citation_issue":"8","citation_publication_date":"2017/08","citation_online_date":"2017/02/21","citation_firstpage":"e17021","citation_lastpage":"e17021","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2017.21","DOI":"10.1038/lsa.2017.21","citation_doi":"10.1038/lsa.2017.21","description":"The fibre-optic microwave photonic link has become one of the basic building blocks for microwave photonics.
