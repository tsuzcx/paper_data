W.

III., we find, as a synonym; Diadema hemisph\u00e6ricum Agass. M. Cotteau, like many continental and American writers, does not interpret the notation of species as is required by the laws of the British Association, but for that reason he should not be accused of committing mistakes which his own writings show him not to have committed. M. Cotteau, in common with others, looks upon nomenclature simply as a matter of registration; and when M. Desor transfers to Pseudodiadema the Diadema hemisph\u00e6ricum Agass., M. Cotteau writes, therefore, Pseudodiadema hemisph\u00e6ricum Desor, and not Agassiz; he may be wrong, according to the principles of the writer in NATURE, but he has not, either in this instance or in the other cases alluded to, committed a mistake through ignorance of the subject.","dc.creator":["AGASSIZ, A."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["AGASSIZ, A."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Cotteau's \u201cEchinides de la Sarthe\u201d","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Cotteau&#39;s &#8220;Echinides de la Sarthe&#8221;&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"004242d0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

That on the 9th commenced at 10 o'clock, and continued with little interruption until 12.45; and last night from 9.40 until 12 o'clock. Both displays were in the north and north-west, and at times the streamers reached the zenith, but I did not observe them to pass beyond that point. The colours were varied; at one time of a beautiful crimson, at another a greenish white. Last night's display was the most interesting, but not so brilliant as that of the previous night. The aurora made its first appearance by an undefined redness in the north; it then gradually developed into a crimson, and assumed the shape of a vertical pillar, the upper part tapering to a clearly defined point, within a few degrees of the zenith. It remained in this shape and position for two minutes, and then faded away. At 10.15 there appeared, at about 10 degrees above the horizon, a peculiar lightness, like the edge of a dark horizontal cloud illuminated by the hidden moon, but I could distinctly discern some stars below the illuminated stratum, which proves that the cloud was transparent; the stars could not, however, be seen through the lightness. At 10.40 there were three distinct streamers shooting up from this light, emanating from separate parts, but all in the north and north-west. They then assumed an easterly movement, the right hand streamer before disappearing being in the north-east. The centre one of these was of a very light colour, approaching a faint or whitish green; the others were crimson. At 11 o'clock I saw an exceedingly brilliant patch undefined in the north-east; by this time some clouds, stratified horizontally, rose from the northern horizon and passed into the light part of the heavens, which seemed to influence the display by intensifying the streamers, which were shooting up, at this time, to the zenith. At 11.30 I saw six beams start across east and west, of a whitish colour with dark spaces between, and the southern one in the zenith. The northern streamer now disappeared, but the auroral twilight was still visible, although gradually fading, and by 12 o'clock all was darkness. I did not continue my observation beyond this hour, the temperature not being conducive to personal comfort.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"5","prism.number":"107","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"44","prism.endingPage":"44","prism.copyright":"1871 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/005044c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/005044c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/005044c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/005044c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Aurora Borealis of Nov. 9 and 10","citation_volume":"5","citation_issue":"107","citation_publication_date":"1871/11","citation_firstpage":"44","citation_lastpage":"44","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/005044c0","DOI":"10.1038/005044c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/005044c0","description":"THERE have been two magnificent auroral displays on the nights of the 9th and 10th inst.

Shortly after this a radiating point became very striking, not in the zenith, but at one-third the distance from the Pleiades to Capella; and then the folds of gorgeous light-red, white, and faint green, interspersed with dark shading, spread from it, like a canopy, down on all sides except in the N. W. I never witnessed or read of such a display in these latitudes. With one of Browning's small star spectroscopes the spectrum consisted of a small portion of brilliant red, then a bright band rather close to it, and then two others beyond; the two latter being rather nearer together than the first and second; that at the more refrangible end being the fainrest, and that near the red the strongest.

From that time, and from that spot, it spread rapidly; a bright white arch extending high overhead from W. to E., while a segment of blue sky stretched low down in the S.E. in the magnetic meridian, the space between being filled with brilliant colours. Shortly after this a radiating point became very striking, not in the zenith, but at one-third the distance from the Pleiades to Capella; and then the folds of gorgeous light-red, white, and faint green, interspersed with dark shading, spread from it, like a canopy, down on all sides except in the N. W. I never witnessed or read of such a display in these latitudes. With one of Browning's small star spectroscopes the spectrum consisted of a small portion of brilliant red, then a bright band rather close to it, and then two others beyond; the two latter being rather nearer together than the first and second; that at the more refrangible end being the fainrest, and that near the red the strongest. I enclose a sketch showing the spectrum, the slit being wide open.","dc.creator":["KEY, HENRY COOPER"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["KEY, HENRY COOPER"],"citation_author_institution":["Stretton Rectory, Hereford"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Aurora of February 4","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Aurora of February 4&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"005303e0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

There was nothing beyond the red on the outside of the primary bow, except, of course, the secondary bow, at some distance.","dc.creator":["THOMPSON, GEORGE C."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["THOMPSON, GEORGE C."],"citation_author_institution":["Cardiff"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Correlation of Colour and Music","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Correlation of Colour and Music&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"006414a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

J. Murphy encourages me to mention a botanical phenomenon which I witnessed in 1865, but have scarcely ever mentioned before for fear of being disbelieved. I was standing on the bank of the little river Evenlode, in Oxfordshire, looking at an old pollard willow trunk about six feet high, when I observed in the decayed wood of the tree an upright sort of staff resembling a dark-coloured old school ruler, and of about that size. I knocked away some of the touchwood above and below, and found my ruler lengthened each way. At the point where it would naturally issue at the top, I found a small twig of undoubted ash, of which the leaves were fully expanded, sprouting up among the branches of willow. Upon clearing away a little more rotten wood I laid bare another ruler, which, like the first, appeared to lengthen upward to the top of the trunk and downward to the ground, but there was no second twig of ash above. The \u201crulers\u201d were rough where they were totally enclosed by the willow, and had put forth little threadlike rootlets. But the part which I found exposed to the air was smoother and looked like a true branch, but was darker than the usual colour of ash.

But I fail to see in what way he has \u201cvindicated the honour of Hastings.\u201d With the exception of one or two sentences which require qualification, his letter is simply an emphatic repetition of what I said in the Hastings and St. Leonards News.

In a semi-wild state on a run horses graze together in large or small companies, which \u201cstation hands\u201d call \u201cmobs;\u201d these mobs wander at will over a large area of country, finding abundance of good natural pasture and water. Some years since a mare became solitary in her habits, always seeking one particular creek ; whenever released from work she made off to her favourite feeding ground by herself ; if \u201crounded up with a mob\u201d she would take the earliest chance that presented itself of reaching her usual haunt. One of her progeny some years after showed a similar liking for solitude ; he was placed among several other horses (many of them he had known for years) on a small run intersected with bushy gullies, more or less rocky.

In a semi-wild state on a run horses graze together in large or small companies, which \u201cstation hands\u201d call \u201cmobs;\u201d these mobs wander at will over a large area of country, finding abundance of good natural pasture and water. Some years since a mare became solitary in her habits, always seeking one particular creek ; whenever released from work she made off to her favourite feeding ground by herself ; if \u201crounded up with a mob\u201d she would take the earliest chance that presented itself of reaching her usual haunt. One of her progeny some years after showed a similar liking for solitude ; he was placed among several other horses (many of them he had known for years) on a small run intersected with bushy gullies, more or less rocky. He was soon missing, and search was made for him for some time without success ; he was supposed to have come to grief in the bush ; at length he was found, most unexpectedly, on a small patch of pasture between two rocky gullies thickly bushed ; this spot was so difficult of access that a slight track had to be cut to get the horse back.

That this is not merely an abridged expression for the resulting actual energy in all the possible different phases that such a system may go through, briefly stated for any initial and final configurations and initial motion of the system by means of the negative scale or potential function of all the several component force-pairs supposed known; not merely, that is to say, a logical consequence of arbitrary and fanciful definitions, but a conclusion full of importance and of real natural signification depends, firstly, upon the fact that the thing defined as \u201cimpulse\u201d, or the gradient of the scale, which is here independent of the time and depends only on the mutual configuration, is not permanent by a very rare occurrence, but that it is often so, and under very various circumstances; and again that this impulse, or flux of momentum, or gradient of energy, occurs in many other motions with conditions of equal simplicity; and lastly, and above all, on the fact pointed out at the beginning of these reflections, that while we are able to use, and of our free will to call into existence force in innumerable ways, we learn from our experience that this impulse is invariably caused or dictated by a certain special efficacy or compulsion, which our power of exercising it as we please so as either to annul, to modify, or to increase it at will with the consequence of obtaining with it any effective impulses that we desire, shows us to be a different kind of quantity from the impulses that we either thus obtain, or that we see it producing in surrounding nature. Newton's second law of motion in fact recognises this specific difference between the magnitudes of a force and of its effect, when it asserts that forces produce their whole effects (that is to say, remain unaffected in their efficacies) whatever may be the state of rest or of motion of the bodies upon which they act. As it is found that forces or compulsions (measured as they are in statics by additions, subtractions, and oppositions to a standard force) are always proportional to the free impulse, or undisturbed acceleration of a mass-unit which they can produce, so that by taking the impulsive effect and the active compulsion of any one standard force as the units for measuring these quantities respectively, they are then said to be numerically equal to each other in every force; it yet follows from their specific independence that they are not identical in kind as they are in measure. The same is true of the products obtained by multiplying them separately by any small space through which a force acts; and it would be an obvious misstatement to assert that the sum of the works of a compulsion, and of the free impulse which it produces taken negatively, is constant when a force acts freely; because this would be confusing in one sum two different quantities; a result which It seems must arise from the simple fact that our part in mechanical \u201ccompulsions\u201d distinguishes and removes them from the category of impulses to which they would otherwise belong, and leads us to regard them as the causes of the impulses which we observe. The language adopted by Newton (and used also by D7'Alembert) in the proposition quoted at the beginning of this letter is that in a proper mechanical system, compulsions equal to the observed impulses reversed, will (as is obvious) arrest in their origin all changes of motion in the system, and will (with the immutable force conditions proper to the system) hold in balance, or give a complete account of all the forces (other than those immutable ones) acting upon it. Using the principle of virtual velocities in this case of equilibrium of balancing forces, Newton expresses the rule for exploring all the mechanical efficacies (superadded to the immutable ones) acting in the system by concluding that the sum of all the similar \u201cworks of compulsion\u201d, or of all the \u201cactions\u201d in a short time corresponding to a small motion of the system, when the reversed ones have been introduced, will be a constant quantity. Thus both Newton and D'Alembert agree in this, that they recognise in forces causes which differ from the effects which they produce. By what similar laws of work found to hold true in a proper conservative system the modern science of energy (which deals with the phenomena of causation in a wider and more diversified form) seeks to extend the method of cancelling the counteracting causes, or the principle of energy conservation here laid down by Newton for a mechanical one, to the far larger, but less thoroughly explored and exhausted field of all the onward flowing streams of physical agencies which we perceive following their natural bents or inclinations around us, I will presently endeavour to explain. It should be noticed in connection with this general extension of the principle, that the \u201cwork\u201d of a force in a short time, however fixed its efficacy, or its rate of doing work in a short space (or of producing momentum in the short time) may be, is incidental, and not a fixed quality of the agent force like its faculty of tension, since a force as often diminishes as increases actual energy by a momentary action, and thus no fixed rule is drawn from the natural tendency of force to impart momentum, that potential energy necessarily becomes, or even necessarily tends to become, actual energy in every mechanical energy-transformation. The mechanical stress of friction is an example of the opposite tendency; and it also furnishes us with an example of a force whose working power only, and not its motive tendency, is a mechanical \u201cagent\u201d which we can summon up at will; but of which we still regard the motive tendency as similar to that of other mechanical forces, because it can maintain equilibrium with them.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"17","prism.number":"434","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"321","prism.endingPage":"322","prism.copyright":"1878 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/017321b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/017321b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/017321b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/017321b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The \u201cPhantom\u201d Force1","citation_volume":"17","citation_issue":"434","citation_publication_date":"1878/02","citation_firstpage":"321","citation_lastpage":"322","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/017321b0","DOI":"10.1038/017321b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/017321b0","description":"IT might be supposed that permanent and entirely local or \u201cinternal\u201d force-pairs of this kind acting on innumerable material couplets in a system would so disturb the individual energies of their motions that no general conclusion as to the total change of energy during the progress of such a system's motion could be drawn; but the simple law that impulses act independently of each other and of existing motions soon shows that the whole gain of energy in the system is the sum of the separate gains in the several mass-couplets due to their absolute or several actions and reactions at every instant of the motion, and that when these abstract force-pairs are all permanent, the above constancy of the sum of their actual and potential energies is possessed by the whole system as perfectly as would be the case by one only of its couplets, or component pairs. That this is not merely an abridged expression for the resulting actual energy in all the possible different phases that such a system may go through, briefly stated for any initial and final configurations and initial motion of the system by means of the negative scale or potential function of all the several component force-pairs supposed known; not merely, that is to say, a logical consequence of arbitrary and fanciful definitions, but a conclusion full of importance and of real natural signification depends, firstly, upon the fact that the thing defined as \u201cimpulse\u201d, or the gradient of the scale, which is here independent of the time and depends only on the mutual configuration, is not permanent by a very rare occurrence, but that it is often so, and under very various circumstances; and again that this impulse, or flux of momentum, or gradient of energy, occurs in many other motions with conditions of equal simplicity; and lastly, and above all, on the fact pointed out at the beginning of these reflections, that while we are able to use, and of our free will to call into existence force in innumerable ways, we learn from our experience that this impulse is invariably caused or dictated by a certain special efficacy or compulsion, which our power of exercising it as we please so as either to annul, to modify, or to increase it at will with the consequence of obtaining with it any effective impulses that we desire, shows us to be a different kind of quantity from the impulses that we either thus obtain, or that we see it producing in surrounding nature. Newton's second law of motion in fact recognises this specific difference between the magnitudes of a force and of its effect, when it asserts that forces produce their whole effects (that is to say, remain unaffected in their efficacies) whatever may be the state of rest or of motion of the bodies upon which they act. As it is found that forces or compulsions (measured as they are in statics by additions, subtractions, and oppositions to a standard force) are always proportional to the free impulse, or undisturbed acceleration of a mass-unit which they can produce, so that by taking the impulsive effect and the active compulsion of any one standard force as the units for measuring these quantities respectively, they are then said to be numerically equal to each other in every force; it yet follows from their specific independence that they are not identical in kind as they are in measure. The same is true of the products obtained by multiplying them separately by any small space through which a force acts; and it would be an obvious misstatement to assert that the sum of the works of a compulsion, and of the free impulse which it produces taken negatively, is constant when a force acts freely; because this would be confusing in one sum two different quantities; a result which It seems must arise from the simple fact that our part in mechanical \u201ccompulsions\u201d distinguishes and removes them from the category of impulses to which they would otherwise belong, and leads us to regard them as the causes of the impulses which we observe.

To take a familiar analogy, it is as if a man should be perfectly able to distinguish the pitch of notes at either end of the scale, but the notes between should either not affect the auditory nerve at all, or should affect it simply as noise.","dc.creator":["PODMORE, FRANK"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["PODMORE, FRANK"],"citation_author_institution":["Pembroke College, Oxford"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Was Homer Colour-blind?","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Was Homer Colour-blind?&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"019221a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

They all came from the sea from the north-west and passed over the land to the south-east. I first noticed the flight at 7.30 A.M. The morning was bright and sunny with a light wind a little south of east Great numbers of V. cardui were soaring at all heights, up to at least 150 feet, above and between the poplars which surround the house in which I am staying; all were going leisurely to the south-east; lower down P. gamma more erratic in its flight, was going in numbers in the same direction. I went down on to the grassy slope above the shore cliff. The blackberry blossoms were covered with V. cardui and P. gamma, three or four on a flower, the fussy moths much disturbing the more sedate butterflies, but each bent on holding its own. With scarcely an exception they took flight in a south-east direction when disturbed or when satisfied with their often, I fear, vain search for food. I stepped fifty paces from a clump of dark first at right angles to their line of flight and counted the butterflies which passed for two intervals of two minutes; the numbers were 95 and 108, but I probably missed some of the higher ones. On the shore at 10 o'clock I counted 73 in one minute pass a space 50 paces in width; at 11.45 in one minute 50 passed the same space. The numbers of P. gamma were more difficult to ascertain owing to their smaller size and more erratic flight, but as they all flew very low on the shore, not more than a foot or two at most above the water or sand, I stepped 20 paces and tried to count the moths passing within those limits with the result\u2014one minute 32 moths, two consecutive minutes 18 moths, again two minutes 120 at least. In the second interval a strong gust of wind checked the flight altogether, and in the third interval the moths came so fast that I missed many I feel sure. The P. gamma were evidently much exhausted; while bathing I saw several floating on the surface of the water, which took flight when touched or crawled on to a finger presented to them; some settled on me and on others while we were bathing. At 12 o'clock I passed uninterruptedly through the flight while walking from Trouville Harbour for a distance of two kilometres northwards along the shore. There was then an occasional white butterfly (Pieris) in the flight, and I also noticed two dragon-flies coming from, the sea and following the same direction as the other insects; I noticed other dragon-flies with the flight inland, but they abound here. Had those coming from the sea accompanied the flight throughout as hawks are said to follow the flights of birds on which tliey prey? From the shore I climbed up the cliff, the grassy slopes above it were swarming with P. gamma and V. cardui, nearly every flower having one visitor at least. At 1.15 P.M. P. gamma passed over in undiminished numbers, but V. cardui was not so abundant. At 5.30 I rode parallel with the coast line along the Honfleur road to a point rather more than 10 kilometres from Trouville, passing through an uninterrupted flight of P. gamma all the way, but no V. cardui, though the butterfly still abounded on the blackberry and other blossoms by the roadside. Throughout the last two kilometres the moths were much fewer in number, but had not quite disappeared when I turned back. P. gamma generally flew lower than V. cardui, but the force which impelled them in one direction, as if their bodies were magnetised and their north pole was in the south-east, was so strong that when they met an obstruction to the course of their flight they went often over it not round it. While riding I noticed that they rose up and flew over isolated buildings, and I was curious to see whether they would do the same with a church tower. As I passed through Villerville, three came over the top of the church tower, and again at Criquebuf, three fluttered up the wall, and flew over the church tower as I passed, it. At 8 P. M. I went up on to the roof of the house; the moths were then flying up the front of the house and over the roof in. great numbers. The flight of P. gamma continued to pass the house in which I am writing, without interruption, from 7.30 A.M. till dark, and are now at 11.30 P.M., flying in at the open window, so as to be a perfect nuisance.

They all came from the sea from the north-west and passed over the land to the south-east. I first noticed the flight at 7.30 A.M. The morning was bright and sunny with a light wind a little south of east Great numbers of V. cardui were soaring at all heights, up to at least 150 feet, above and between the poplars which surround the house in which I am staying; all were going leisurely to the south-east; lower down P. gamma more erratic in its flight, was going in numbers in the same direction.

Whilst we are still quite in ignorance of the nature of this invention, it may be well to intimate that complete means for seeing by telegraphy have been known for some time by scientific men. The following plan has often been discussed by us with our friends, and, no doubt, has suggested itself to others acquainted with the physical discoveries of the last four years. It has not been carried out because of its elaborate nature, and on account of its expensive character, nor should we recommend its being carried out in this form. But if the new American invention, to which reference has been made, should turn out to be some plan of this kind, then this letter may do good in preventing monopoly in an invention which really is the joint property of Willoughby Smith, Sabine, and other scientific men, rather than of a particular man who has had sufficient money and leisure to carry out the idea. The plan, which was suggested to us some three years ago more immediately by a picture in Punch, and governed by Willoughby Smith's experiments, was this:\u2014Our transmitter at A consisted of a large surface made up of very small separate squares of selenium. One end of each piece was connected by an insulated wire with the distant place, B, and the other end of each piece connected with the ground, in accordance with the plan commonly employed with telegraph instruments. The object whose image was to be sent by telegraph was illuminated very strongly, and, by means of a lens, a very large image thrown on the surface of the transmitter. Now it is well known that if each little piece of selenium forms part of a circuit in which there is a constant electromotive force, say of a Voltaic battery, the current passing through each piece will depend on its illumination. Hence the strength of electric current in each telegraph line would depend on the illumination of its extremity. Our receiver at the distant place, B, was, in our original plan, a collection of magnetic needles, the position of each of which (as in the ordinary needle telegraph) was controlled by the electric current passing through the particular telegraph wire with which it was connected. Each magnet, by its movement, closed or opened an aperture through which light passed to illuminate the back of a small square of frosted glass. There were, of course, as many of these illuminated squares at B as of selenium squares at A, and it is quite evident that since the illumination of each square depends on the strength of the current in its circuit, and this current depends on the illumination of the selenium at the other end of the wire, the image of a distant object would in this way be transmitted as a mosaic by electricity.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"21","prism.number":"547","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"589","prism.endingPage":"589","prism.copyright":"1880 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/021589a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/021589a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/021589a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/021589a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Seeing by Electricity","citation_volume":"21","citation_issue":"547","citation_publication_date":"1880/04","citation_firstpage":"589","citation_lastpage":"589","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/021589a0","DOI":"10.1038/021589a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/021589a0","description":"WE hear that a sealed account of an invention for seeing by telegraphy has been deposited by the inventor of the telephone.

The light was so bright that in the distance it looked like moonlight through the trees; and had the moon been shining we should probably not again have thought about the light until we came upon it. But it was a dark night, though warm and even sultry, and still. The light was so bright that, taking a letter out of my pocket, I could read it. It resembled an electric light, and proceeded from the bodies of two centipedes and their two trails. The centipedes were about four inches apart.

The light was so bright that in the distance it looked like moonlight through the trees; and had the moon been shining we should probably not again have thought about the light until we came upon it. But it was a dark night, though warm and even sultry, and still. The light was so bright that, taking a letter out of my pocket, I could read it. It resembled an electric light, and proceeded from the bodies of two centipedes and their two trails. The centipedes were about four inches apart. The light illumined the entire body of the animal, and seemed to increase its diameter three times. It flashed along both sides of the creature in sections; there being about six sections from head to tail, between which the light played. The light behaved precisely like the electric light, moving as it were perpetually in two streams, one on each side, and yet lighting up the whole body.

Its small constituency is of a somewhat peculiar kind, drawn from many sources, not by mere \u201cgravitation,\u201d but by natural choice, and probably would not follow it if removed to a town. When the Tay Bridge has been set up again, St. Andrews will be within thirty-five minutes of Dundee. The changes which may result from this are difficult to forecast. Meanwhile the University is doing, although a limited, yet a good and useful work, and is blessed with many distinguished sons.

The form of the bones, which are undoubtedly identical with those in the British Museum specimen determined by Prof. Marsh to be clavicles, is exactly that of clavicles and unlike that of any known sternal bones.

The latter left a very vivid bluish light in its path, which lasted about ten seconds. At 10.55 a very large meteor dropped right down from Psi Urs\u00e6 Majoris, and disappeared in a black cloud a few degrees above the horizon. At 11.10 one sped rapidly from Beta Urs\u00e6 Minoris through between Epsilon and Zeta (Mizar) Urs\u00e6 Majoris, and exploded in very brilliant white light. At 11.20 one proceeded from a point about 1\u00b0 below Benetnasch, and disappeared in the right shoulder of Hercules without explosion. At 11.25 one blazed out from a point 2\u00b0 above Etanin, and disappeared near Beta Cygni. At 11.30 a large and brilliant but a transient meteor went from Omicron Urs\u00e6 Majoris, and disappeared in the tail of the Dragon. At 11.35 one dashed out from a point about 1\u00b0 above Pi Urs\u00e6 Majoris, and I thought that it would go through Merak, but just before it reached Merak it curved suddenly from it and exploded. About 12 a number of small ones were seen. December 1\u2014Meteors seen at 0.13 a.m., 0.18, 1.12, 1.23, 1.45, 3.30, 3.40, 4, 4.23, 4.40, 4.55, 5.7, 5.10, 5.18.

On November 30 and December 1 last there was a brilliant display of meteors. A few Leonids, Leo Minorids, Taurids, and Geminids were seen. Six Andromedes made their appearance from December 4 to 8. On December 8 a beautiful bolide rushed through the clouds from south-west to south-east, at 6 p.m. Not a star in that part of the heavens could be seen at the time, but the moon shone dimly a little to the left of it. The point at which it appeared was a few degrees higher than the moon, and it disappeared a few degrees above the earth. It blazed in and out three different times on its way through the black clouds, and a little before the end of its journey it swelled cut into a huge magnificent ball of red fire, and by its explosion it illumined the western heavens and earth with its bright crimson light. A few of the spectators were alarmed at the unusual apparition. No intonation. Left in its wake a red belt of fire. The light of most of the meteors was blue, or the colour of electric light.

We must look deeper for the cause.","dc.creator":["SAYLES, IRA"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["SAYLES, IRA"],"citation_author_institution":["Washington, D.C."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Ravens in the United States","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Ravens in the United States&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"029502c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Though they are detached from each other, they form a watershed between the coast and the inland drainage, and thus the River Perak has to drain an immense valley in a north and south direction until it finds an outlet to the south of the Dindings.","dc.creator":["TENISON-WOODS, J.

In working with two 8-inch needles I continually observed this phenomenon for years, and it was so marked that I could not feel satisfied to omit the precaution which the critic condemns.

As one walked across a field, stars appeared to start forth by thousands from amongst the fresh-fallen snow. They were particularly bright and numerous when one walked in the direction of the sun. They appeared almost at all distances, and almost of all sizes, those near at hand being never very large but of great brilliancy and most exquisite colour. The phenomenon was sufficiently striking to induce me to stop and observe it more closely, and the first thing I noticed on stopping was the permanence of each little star of light, although the snow was dropping melted from the hedges and trees by the heat of the sun. A slight movement of the head was sufficient to change the colour of a red star to green or vice vers\u00e2. It seemed as if the most brilliant colours were seen when looking in a direction nearly but not quite towards the sun. The level surface of the snow appeared as if strewn with gems\u2014and not only near at hand, for even twenty and thirty yards away a large star would shine forth with a subdued but fine colour. I then noticed a peculiar uniformity of shape in these reflections from snow crystals. The shape never varied from that of a blunt arrow-head. This was very striking in the large stars which appeared at a distance; but once noticed, it was obvious enough that even the minute specks at one's feet were all of this form. Nor did the position of the snow vary to any appreciable extent. The inclination seemed always a little to the right, and this occurred no matter in what direction I looked, whether towards the sun, or away from it, or in any other direction. Wishing to know the absolute size of the larger snow crystals, or combination of crystals, I looked for a fine appearance, and estimated as well as I could its magnitude by covering it with a small object held at arm's length. The distance of the spot where the crystal appeared proved to be forty-three paces from where I stood, and its magnitude could not have been much less than three inches in this particular case. Now if, as I suspect, the form of the star which appears so persistently is due to the upper or lower stem only of a complete arrangement of crystals in an hexagonal shape, these combinations must occasionally be six inches or more in diameter. I did not succeed in recognizing any larger than very minute arrangements of crystals in the snow itself, but it is obvious that the sun's rays reflected from a long distance must single out those faces of crystals which happen to be parallel to one another over a certain limited area.

We were led to the experiments by another investigation on the behaviour of carbon at high temperatures in various gases. We find that when a platinum wire is heated to nearly melting by a current in an atmosphere of chlorine, the walls of the glass vessel become covered with a yellow deposit, which is insoluble in water, but dissolves in hydrochloric acid, and then, after addition of a little nitric acid, gives all the reactions of platinic chloride.

We were led to the experiments by another investigation on the behaviour of carbon at high temperatures in various gases. We find that when a platinum wire is heated to nearly melting by a current in an atmosphere of chlorine, the walls of the glass vessel become covered with a yellow deposit, which is insoluble in water, but dissolves in hydrochloric acid, and then, after addition of a little nitric acid, gives all the reactions of platinic chloride. The yellow deposit is in fact platinous chloride. At the same time the thick part of the platinum wire conveying the current, and which was not heated very highly, became incrusted with very fine long crystals of platinum. Some of these were more than the sixteenth of an inch in length, and apparently considerably more were located on that end of the thick wire leading to the negative pole than on the other.","dc.creator":["HODGKINSON, W.

J. Parker has in these pages (Dec. 11, 1890, p. 142) lately recorded the existence of a sternum in the shark Notidanus indicus. The anterior of the two cartilages which he figures has been already described by Haswell (Proc. Linn. Soc. N.S.W., vol. ix., part 1); and, in view of Parker's conclusions, it is interesting to note that he speaks of it (p. 23) as \u201ctemptingly like the presternal,\u201d but that \u201cthe presence of such an element in the skeleton of any group nearer than the Amphibia seems to preclude this explanation.\u201d That the Amphibian sternum is for the most part, if not wholly, a derivative of the shoulder-girdle, there can no longer be a question; and, although the researches of Goette leave us in doubt concerning the hypo (post-omo) sternum, they show that that can be no derivative of the costal apparatus. Working anatomists will realize in Parker's application of Albrecht's terminology the expression of a fundamental difference between the sternal skeleton of the Ichthyopsida and Amniota. The researches of Goette, Hoffmann, Ruge, and others, show the sternum of the higher Amniota to consist of a greater costal portion and of lesser ones, chief among the latter being the episternum or interclavicle.

J. Parker has in these pages (Dec. 11, 1890, p. 142) lately recorded the existence of a sternum in the shark Notidanus indicus. The anterior of the two cartilages which he figures has been already described by Haswell (Proc. Linn. Soc. N.S.W., vol. ix., part 1); and, in view of Parker's conclusions, it is interesting to note that he speaks of it (p. 23) as \u201ctemptingly like the presternal,\u201d but that \u201cthe presence of such an element in the skeleton of any group nearer than the Amphibia seems to preclude this explanation.\u201d That the Amphibian sternum is for the most part, if not wholly, a derivative of the shoulder-girdle, there can no longer be a question; and, although the researches of Goette leave us in doubt concerning the hypo (post-omo) sternum, they show that that can be no derivative of the costal apparatus. Working anatomists will realize in Parker's application of Albrecht's terminology the expression of a fundamental difference between the sternal skeleton of the Ichthyopsida and Amniota. The researches of Goette, Hoffmann, Ruge, and others, show the sternum of the higher Amniota to consist of a greater costal portion and of lesser ones, chief among the latter being the episternum or interclavicle. They suggest (especially if Hoffmann's assertion that the precoracoid or clavicular bar is, in Mammals, primarily continuous with the spine of the scapula)that the interclavicle may be, throughout, the vanishing vestige of the coracoidal sternum of the Ichthyopsida. The latter would appear, therefore, to have been replaced in time by the more familiar costal sternum, derivative of the h\u00e6mal arches (ribs); and, this being so, might we not boldly, and with advantage, go a step further than Parker has done, and distinguish between a coracoidal archisternum of the Ichthyopsida, and a h\u00e6mocoracoidal neosternum of the Amniota?

In the first place, I do not allow that there is any \u201cfortuity\u201d in the supposition that certain variations, A, B, C, D, &c, may arise in the same individual, for every variation, of whatever kind, must of necessity entail numerous structural and functional modifications.

In Germany they are for this reason said to be the inventors of telegraphy. This is, to say the least, a somewhat sweeping statement, as the possibility of communicating by electricity was known long before that time. However, there is no doubt that Weber and Gauss played some part in introducing telegraphy into practice. For my part I consider the purely scientific work of either of the two men more glorious. For the enormous practical consequences of telegraphy have nothing to do with the scientific merit of the invention.

In Germany they are for this reason said to be the inventors of telegraphy. This is, to say the least, a somewhat sweeping statement, as the possibility of communicating by electricity was known long before that time. However, there is no doubt that Weber and Gauss played some part in introducing telegraphy into practice. For my part I consider the purely scientific work of either of the two men more glorious. For the enormous practical consequences of telegraphy have nothing to do with the scientific merit of the invention.

In his experiments, samples of nitrogen purified by different methods gave different values for the density of the gas. Rayleigh's persistence in tracking down this anomaly led to the discovery, with William Ramsay, of the first noble gas \u2014 argon \u2014 in 1895 [Rayleigh, Lord & Ramsay, W. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A 186, 187 (1895)]. By the end of the century, helium, neon, krypton and xenon had all been isolated, and in 1904 Rayleigh and Ramsay won Nobel prizes for their work \u2014 Rayleigh in physics and Ramsay in chemistry.","dc.creator":["RAYLEIGH"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["RAYLEIGH"],"citation_author_institution":["Terling Place, Witham, September 24."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Density of Nitrogen","twitter:description":"Nature - &quot;I am much puzzled by some recent results as to the density of nitrogen,&quot; admitted Lord Rayleigh in a Nature issue of 1892.

One of the colts was also striped on the neck and some other parts of the body; lastly, the mane in both resembled that of the quagga, being short, stiff, and upright.

FORBES has been kind enough to send me for examination the typical specimen of Dendrexetastes capitoides of Eyton, now in the Derby Museum, Liverpool, to which he has called attention in a letter in NATURE of October 24 last (NATURE, vol. lii. p. 619). I have compared it with specimen a of Dendrexetastes temmincki in the British Museum, and do not hesitate for a moment to say that they are referable to the same species. Both are from Cayenne, and of the ordinary unmistakable \u201cCayenne make.\u201d But it is quite true that, as pointed out by Dr. Forbes, the cross-bands on the belly, which are very visible in the British Museum specimen, are quite non-apparent in the Derby Museum specimen.

FORBES has been kind enough to send me for examination the typical specimen of Dendrexetastes capitoides of Eyton, now in the Derby Museum, Liverpool, to which he has called attention in a letter in NATURE of October 24 last (NATURE, vol. lii. p. 619). I have compared it with specimen a of Dendrexetastes temmincki in the British Museum, and do not hesitate for a moment to say that they are referable to the same species. Both are from Cayenne, and of the ordinary unmistakable \u201cCayenne make.\u201d But it is quite true that, as pointed out by Dr. Forbes, the cross-bands on the belly, which are very visible in the British Museum specimen, are quite non-apparent in the Derby Museum specimen. These cross-bands are, in all probability, remnants of the immature plumage, the British Museum specimen being not quite adult. I was, therefore, wrong in using this character (\u201cCat.

A flame is almost transparent to the X-rays; on taking a shadowgraph of a lighted candle or gas jet, the shadow of the flame is just visible as an exceedingly faint impression, the internal core in the case of the gas flame being slightly more marked than the external.","dc.creator":["TURNER, DAWSON"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["TURNER, DAWSON"],"citation_author_institution":["Edinburgh"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The R\u00f6ntgen Rays","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The R&#246;ntgen Rays&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"053462a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In this matter I cannot seek the aid of parents, for they are scarcely unbiased observers, but I have to appeal for aid to those who teach in schools, and have thus an independent and often extensive knowledge of their pupils' characters. This is very frequently combined with the scientific training and caution which renders the teacher's aid of special value. As it is necessary to obtain measurements and observations of both sexes, I have appealed to both men and women teachers, and as it is also needful to combine the sexes (in the brother-sister measurements) to those working in elementary schools, as well as in boys' public schools and in girls' high schools. The result of my appeal has been to bring me a great deal of most valuable aid. Several high schools have been dealt with, four of our chief public schools have been, or are being measured, and a considerable variety of private, elementary sand other schools. But a single public school (even of 500 to 700 boys) will often have only ten to twenty pairs of brethren, not, perhaps, as many as in a village national school, and I am most desirous of getting further help. The determination of the strength of collateral heredity is a problem of great scientific importance, and it can only be achieved by co-operative action. I have found so many teachers in all classes of schools willing to give disinterested aid in the cause of science that I venture to make a further appeal through NATURE for more assistance. Besides observations of physical and mental characters, which can be recorded without measurement, my data papers ask for certain head-measurements, which can, following the printed instructions, be taken quite easily. I shall be most glad to send sample papers to any one willing to assist, and if, after considering these, they find themselves able to assist, say by filling in data papers for ten or more pairs of brothers or sisters, I will at once despatch a head-spanner, of which I have several at the present time, free. The head-spanner should not be retained (unless under special circumstances) for more than a few weeks. Where the school is a small one, one master has, as a rule, filled in the papers entirely; in larger schools, one of the science masters, or even the medical officer, has done the head-measurements, and the other data have been provided by house, form or consulting masters.

This insect is fond of lying on the ground among leaves, &c, and birds will hunt it out and catch it.\u201d Among other enemies of British Lepidoptera, Mr. Wise notes that \u201cbats feed largely on the night-flying moths; Tryphoena ianthina is one I have seen them catch.\u201d My friend also refers to a note by G. C. Dudgeon, in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society for March 20, 1895, on the King Crow (Dicrurus longicaudatus) catching a butterfly (Teinopalpus imperialis, ), and adds, \u201cIn the case of a jungle-fire in an Indian forest, birds at once come and catch the numerous insects which fly up for safety, the above-mentioned King Crow being always to the fore.\u201d In India also lizards are formidable enemies to Lepidoptera. Mr. Wise says, \u201cin Bombay there is hardly a lamppost which has not got a gecko on it; these feed on the moths which are attracted to the light.\u201d","dc.creator":["VELEY, LILIAN J."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["VELEY, LILIAN J."],"citation_author_institution":["Oxford"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Birds attacking Butterflies and Moths","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Birds attacking Butterflies and Moths&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"065414a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

To see diffraction bands by its means, it is only necessary to close the two halves of the rule until they are almost in contact and then to fold them over. On looking at the sun or other bright source of light through both slits, a series of brilliant diffraction bands will be seen.","dc.creator":["HALL, WILFRED"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["HALL, WILFRED"],"citation_author_institution":["Tynemouth"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Simple Means of Producing Diffraction Effects","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Simple Means of Producing Diffraction Effects&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"066440f0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It seems, therefore, worth while inquiring what their behaviour would be if they were liable to become discharged again at a later collision, and to go on repeating this cycle during the ionising portion of their path. Very possibly the particle is capable of losing more than one electron, in which case it would seem certain that it will have a greater charge at some portions of its path than at others. Looked at in this way the problem is a statistical one of considerable complexity, but my point of view will be sufficiently well illustrated by considering the average \u03b1 particle to behave as if it had the following constitution. For a distance x of its path it possesses an electric charge e. This is succeeded by a distance x\u2032, during which its electric charge is e\u2032. This is followed by a distance x with charge e, then a distance, x\u2032 with charge e\u2032, and so on, repeating indefinitely. Let the particle have a mass m and initial velocity v0, then, confining our attention to a portion of the path so small that v0 is not appreciably diminished by the collisions which occur, it is easy to show that the quantity measured by the electrostatic deflection as mv02/e would really be mv02(x + x\u2032)/ex + e\u2032x\u2032, whilst the quantity measured by the electromagnetic deflection as mv0/e would be mv0(x + x\u2032)/ex + e\u2032x\u2032. Thus the measurements would give v0 correctly, but the quantity denoted by e/m would ex + e\u2032x\u2032/m(x + x\u2032) be.

In Astronomische Nachrichten, Nos. 4341\u20132, your reviewer will find a fuller explanation of the method of capture, and other papers yet to come will make the theory so clear that it need not take up more of your valuable space at present.","dc.creator":["SEE, T.

In the second edition of my book on \u201cTheoretical Mechanics\u201d I have expressed my ideas on the subject at such length that it is unnecessary to go into details here. It may suffice to say that the first two of Prof. Barton's proposed enunciations seem to me to be too abbreviated to be of much value.

There are species which may spawn in fresh or brackish water, and species which may spawn in salt or in brackish water. In short, it may be said that fishes present every degree of anadromous migration from mid-ocean to the upper limits of streams, and corresponding catadromous migrations.

To my eyes, the best yellow is just on the green side of the D lines in the spectrum, but if the eye is fatigued with red light the yellow is changed to greenish-yellow, and if fatigued with green it is changed to orange, that is, the yellow changes in colour towards the unfatigued sensation. Testing by means of a sodium flame gives the same result. In making this test, the flame should not be used immediately after lighting it, as it then contains, in addition to the bright yellow lines, a continuous spectrum. The test should be made when the flame is nearly burnt out and the salt crackling. In that condition only the yellow lines are visible, and it shows the change better than in its first condition.

We present new immunocytochemical evidence showing reductions in Reelin expression in hippocampus of subjects with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression and confirm recent reports documenting a similar deficit involving Reelin expression in brains of subjects with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.","dc.creator":["Fatemi, S H","Earle, J A","McMenomy, T"],"dc.subject":["Medicine/Public Health, general","Psychiatry","Neurosciences","Behavioral Sciences","Pharmacotherapy","Biological Psychology"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=J Neurosci; citation_title=Reelin is a secreted glycoprotein recognized by the CR-50 monoclonal antibody; citation_author=G D'Arcangelo, K Nakajima, T Miyata, M Ogawa, K Mikoshiba, T Curran; citation_volume=17; citation_publication_date=1997; citation_pages=23-31; citation_doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.17-01-00023.1997; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Genomics; citation_title=A YAC contig containing the reeler locus with preliminary characterization of candidate gene fragments; citation_author=I Bar, C Lambert de Rouvroit, I Royaux, DB Krizman, C Dernancourt, D Ruelle; citation_volume=26; citation_publication_date=1995; citation_pages=543-549; citation_doi=10.1016/0888-7543(95)80173-J; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=A protein related to extracellular matrix proteins deleted in the mouse mutant reeler; citation_author=G D'Arcangelo, GG Miao, S-C Chen, HD Soares, JI Morgan, T Curran; citation_volume=374; citation_publication_date=1995; citation_pages=719-723; citation_doi=10.1038/374719a0; citation_id=CR3","citation_journal_title=Cell; citation_title=F-Spondin: a gene expressed at high levels in the floor plate encodes a secreted protein that promotes neural cell adhesion and neurite extension; citation_author=A Klar, M Baldassare, TM Jessell; citation_volume=69; citation_publication_date=1992; citation_pages=95-110; citation_doi=10.1016/0092-8674(92)90121-R; citation_id=CR4","citation_journal_title=Symp Soc Exp Biol; citation_title=Tenascin function and regulation of expression; citation_author=N Vrucinic, RR Chiquet-Ehrismann; citation_volume=47; citation_publication_date=1993; citation_pages=155-162; citation_id=CR5","citation_journal_title=Anat Embryol; citation_title=An early developmental defect in the cerebral cortex of the Reeler mouse; citation_author=AM Goffinet; citation_volume=157; citation_publication_date=1979; citation_pages=205-216; citation_doi=10.1007/BF00305160; citation_id=CR6","citation_journal_title=Neuron; citation_title=The reeler gene-associated antigen on Cajal\u2013Retzius neurons is a crucial molecule for laminar organization of cortical neurons; citation_author=M Ogawa, T Miyata, K Nakajima, K Yagyu, M Seike, K Ikenaka; citation_volume=14; citation_publication_date=1995; citation_pages=899-912; citation_doi=10.1016/0896-6273(95)90329-1; citation_id=CR7","citation_journal_title=J Neurosci; citation_title=Reelin regulates entorhino-hippocampal connections; citation_author=V Borrell, JA Del Rio, S Alcantra, M Derer, A Martinez, G D'Arcangelo; citation_volume=19; citation_publication_date=1999; citation_pages=1345-1358; citation_doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.19-04-01345.1999; citation_id=CR8","citation_journal_title=Proc Natl Acad Sci; citation_title=Colocalization of integrin receptors and Reelin in dendritic spine post-synaptic densities of adult non-human primate cortex; citation_author=MA Rodriguez, C Pesold, WS Liu, V Kriho, A Guidotti, GD Pappas; citation_volume=97; citation_publication_date=2000; citation_pages=3550-3555; citation_doi=10.1073/pnas.97.7.3550; citation_id=CR9","citation_journal_title=Proc Natl Acad Sci; citation_title=A decrease of Reelin expression as a putative vulnerability factor in schizophrenia; citation_author=F Impagnatiello, A Guidotti, C Pesold, Y Dwlivedi, H Caruncho, MG Pisu; citation_volume=95; citation_publication_date=1998; citation_pages=15718-15723; citation_doi=10.1073/pnas.95.26.15718; citation_id=CR10","citation_journal_title=Proc Natl Acad Sci; citation_title=Expression of Reelin in adult mammalian blood, liver, pituitary pars intermedia, and adrenal chromaffin cells; citation_author=NR Smallheiser, E Costa, A Guidotti, F Impagnatiello, J Auta, P Lacor; citation_volume=97; citation_publication_date=2000; citation_pages=1281-1286; citation_doi=10.1073/pnas.97.3.1281; citation_id=CR11","Guidotti A, Auta J, Davis J, Dwivedi Y, Grayson D, Impagnatiello F et al.

Studies in Africa have shown that severe malaria is associated with the ability of erythrocytes infected with the parasite Plasmodium falciparum to bind uninfected erythrocytes and form rosettes2,3,4,5. The molecular basis of rosetting is not well understood, although a group of low-molecular-mass proteins called rosettins have been described as potential parasite ligands6. Infected erythrocytes also bind to endothelial cells, and this interaction is mediated by the parasite-derived variant erythrocyte membrane protein PfEMP1 (refs 7, 8), which is encoded by the var gene family9,10,11.

Studies in Africa have shown that severe malaria is associated with the ability of erythrocytes infected with the parasite Plasmodium falciparum to bind uninfected erythrocytes and form rosettes2,3,4,5. The molecular basis of rosetting is not well understood, although a group of low-molecular-mass proteins called rosettins have been described as potential parasite ligands6. Infected erythrocytes also bind to endothelial cells, and this interaction is mediated by the parasite-derived variant erythrocyte membrane protein PfEMP1 (refs 7, 8), which is encoded by the var gene family9,10,11. Here we report that the parasite ligand for rosetting in a P. falciparum clone is PfEMP1, encoded by a specific var gene. We also report that complement-receptor 1 (CR1) on erythrocytes plays a role in the formation of rosettes and that erythrocytes with a common African CR1 polymorphism (Sl(a\u2212))12 have reduced adhesion to the domain of PfEMP1 that binds normal erythrocytes.

Here we report the X-ray structures of oedema factor with and without bound calmodulin. Oedema factor shares no significant structural homology with mammalian adenylyl cyclases or other proteins. In the active site, 3\u2032-deoxy-ATP and a single metal ion are well positioned for catalysis with histidine 351 as the catalytic base. This mechanism differs from the mechanism of two-metal-ion catalysis proposed for mammalian adenylyl cyclases.

Here we report the X-ray structures of oedema factor with and without bound calmodulin. Oedema factor shares no significant structural homology with mammalian adenylyl cyclases or other proteins. In the active site, 3\u2032-deoxy-ATP and a single metal ion are well positioned for catalysis with histidine 351 as the catalytic base. This mechanism differs from the mechanism of two-metal-ion catalysis proposed for mammalian adenylyl cyclases. Four discrete regions of oedema factor form a surface that recognizes an extended conformation of calmodulin, which is very different from the collapsed conformation observed in other structures of calmodulin bound to effector peptides. On calmodulin binding, an oedema factor helical domain of relative molecular mass 15,000 undergoes a 15\u2009\u00c5 translation and a 30\u00b0 rotation away from the oedema factor catalytic core, which stabilizes a disordered loop and leads to enzyme activation.

Thus, acetate generation from organic matter during burial may explain the presence of a deep bacterial biosphere in marine sediments, and could underpin an even deeper and hotter biosphere than has previously been considered.","dc.creator":["Wellsbury, Peter","Goodman, Kim","Barth, Tanja","Cragg, Barry A.","Barnes, Stephen P.","Parkes, R.

Indeed, pulse reshaping also occurs for long pulses, even if only at the leading edge of the pulse.","dc.creator":["B\u00fcttiker, Markus","Washburn, Sean"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_author=M B\u00fcttiker, S Washburn; citation_volume=422; citation_publication_date=2003; citation_pages=271-272; citation_doi=10.1038/422271a; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Ann.

Here we show that the Akt serine\u2013threonine kinase6 is involved in the activation of NF-\u03baB by tumour necrosis factor (TNF). TNF activates phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) and its downstream target Akt (protein kinase B). Wortmannin (a PI(3)K inhibitor), dominant-negative PI(3)K or kinase-dead Akt inhibits TNF-mediated NF-\u03baB activation. Constitutively active Akt induces NF-\u03baB activity and this effect is blocked by dominant-negative NIK. Conversely, NIK activates NF-\u03baB and this is blocked by kinase-dead Akt.

Here we show that the Akt serine\u2013threonine kinase6 is involved in the activation of NF-\u03baB by tumour necrosis factor (TNF). TNF activates phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) and its downstream target Akt (protein kinase B). Wortmannin (a PI(3)K inhibitor), dominant-negative PI(3)K or kinase-dead Akt inhibits TNF-mediated NF-\u03baB activation. Constitutively active Akt induces NF-\u03baB activity and this effect is blocked by dominant-negative NIK. Conversely, NIK activates NF-\u03baB and this is blocked by kinase-dead Akt. Thus, both Akt and NIK are necessary for TNF activation of NF-\u03baB. Akt mediates IKK\u03b1 phosphorylation at threonine 23. Mutation of this amino acid blocks phosphorylation by Akt or TNF and activation of NF-\u03baB.

Here we report direct measurements of vertical mixing, by convection and by turbulence, from a sulphur hexafluoride tracer-release experiment in the central Greenland Sea gyre. In summer, we found rapid turbulent vertical mixing of about 1.1\u2009cm2\u2009s-1. In the following late winter, part of the water column was mixed more vigorously by convection, indicated by the rising and vertical redistribution of the tracer patch in the centre of the gyre. At the same time, mixing outside the gyre centre was only slightly greater than in summer. The results suggest that about 10% of the water in the gyre centre was vertically transported in convective plumes, which reached from the surface to, at their deepest, 1,200\u20131,400\u2009m. Convection was limited to a very restricted area, however, and smaller volumes of water were transported to depth than previously estimated9.

Here we report direct measurements of vertical mixing, by convection and by turbulence, from a sulphur hexafluoride tracer-release experiment in the central Greenland Sea gyre. In summer, we found rapid turbulent vertical mixing of about 1.1\u2009cm2\u2009s-1. In the following late winter, part of the water column was mixed more vigorously by convection, indicated by the rising and vertical redistribution of the tracer patch in the centre of the gyre. At the same time, mixing outside the gyre centre was only slightly greater than in summer. The results suggest that about 10% of the water in the gyre centre was vertically transported in convective plumes, which reached from the surface to, at their deepest, 1,200\u20131,400\u2009m. Convection was limited to a very restricted area, however, and smaller volumes of water were transported to depth than previously estimated9. Our results imply that it may be the rapid year-round turbulent mixing, rather than convection, that dominates vertical mixing in the region as a whole.","dc.creator":["Watson, A.

Reducing nucleosome content by depleting histone H4 caused increased expression of 15% of genes and reduced expression of 10% of genes, but it had\u00a0little effect on expression of the majority (75%) of yeast genes.\u00a0Telomere-proximal genes were found to be de-repressed over regions extending 20 kilobases from the telomeres, well beyond the extent of Sir protein binding11,12 and the effects of loss of Sir function. These results indicate that histones make Sir-independent contributions to telomeric silencing, and that the role of histones located elsewhere in chromosomes is gene specific rather than generally repressive.","dc.creator":["Wyrick, John J.","Holstege, Frank C.

However, it is a challenge to create a high CRI white light from a single-doped activator. Here, we present a high CRI (Ra = 91) white-light phosphor, Sr5(PO4)3-x(BO3)xCl:Eu2+, composed of Sr5(PO4)3Cl as the beginning member and Sr5(BO3)3Cl as the end member. This work utilized the solid-solution method, and tunable Eu2+ emission was achieved. Color-tunable Eu2+ emissions in response to structural variation were observed in Sr5(PO4)3-x(BO3)xCl solid solutions. This was further confirmed using X-ray Rietveld refinement, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and in the photoluminescence spectra. The color-tunable emissions included the white light that originated from the combination of the blue emission of Sr5(PO4)3Cl:Eu2+ and an induced Eu2+ yellow emission at approximately 550 nm in the solid solution. Importantly, the white-light phosphors showed a greater R9 = 90.2 under excitation at 365 nm. This result has rarely been reported in the literature and is greater than that of (R9 = 14.3) commercial Y3Al5O12:Ce3+-based WLEDs. These findings demonstrate the great potential of Sr5(PO4)3-x(BO3)xCl:0.04Eu2+ as a white-light phosphor for near-UV phosphor-converted WLEDs. These results also provide a shortcut for developing a high CRI white-light phosphor from a single Eu2+-doped compound. A white light-emitting diode with a very high colour rendering index is made using a phosphor based on a europium-doped oxychloride material. A team of scientists from China, Switzerland and the USA investigated the white-light phosphor Sr5(PO4)3\u2212x(BO3)xCl:Eu2+. Its structural and electronic properties were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and fluorescence decay analysis of the phosphor. When excited by ultraviolet light (365 nanometres) from a light-emitting diode, the phosphor emitted broadband photoluminescence with peaks in the blue (446 nanometres) and yellow (550 nanometres) regions. These emission characteristics resulted in high-quality white light with a very high colour rendering index that was significantly better than those of existing commercial white light-emitting diodes based on the phosphor YAG:Ce3+, indicating the potential of this new phosphor.","prism.publicationName":"Light: Science & Applications","prism.publicationDate":"2016-02-12","prism.volume":"5","prism.number":"2","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"e16024","prism.endingPage":"e16024","prism.copyright":"2016 The Author(s)","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201624","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2016.24","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201624.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201624","citation_journal_title":"Light: Science & Applications","citation_journal_abbrev":"Light Sci Appl","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"2047-7538","citation_title":"A single Eu2+-activated high-color-rendering oxychloride white-light phosphor for white-light-emitting diodes","citation_volume":"5","citation_issue":"2","citation_publication_date":"2016/02","citation_online_date":"2016/02/12","citation_firstpage":"e16024","citation_lastpage":"e16024","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2016.24","DOI":"10.1038/lsa.2016.24","citation_doi":"10.1038/lsa.2016.24","description":"Single-phased, high-color-rendering index (CRI) white-light phosphors are emerging as potential phosphor-converted white-light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) and as an alternative to blends of tricolor phosphors.

Although isoprenoid hydrocarbons up to C25 have been recognized11, pristane (C19) and phytane (C20) are usually the most important in terms of concentration. Both are considered to be products of the diagenesis of the phytyl side chain of chlorophyll5, although other sources are possible12\u201314. In coals5, pristane is formed by decarboxylation of phytanic acid, and phytane by dehydration and hydrogenation of phytol. Differences in the ratio of pristane to phytane may reflect variations in the degree of oxidation during the early stages of chlorophyll degradation5. Thus the formation of phytanic acid, the precursor of pristane, should occur to a greater extent on land during the initial, aerobic stages of plant decay than in an aquatic environment where totally anaerobic decomposition is more likely. High ratios of pristane to phytane, which are found in bituminous coals5 and certain Australian oils5, may reflect source material of terrestrial origin. The ratios of phytanic acid to phytol (plus dihydrophytol) in Dead Sea sediments were 4.7 and 5.5 in two oxidizing environments and 1.1 and 3.4 in two reducing environments14. Clearly the formation of phytanic acid is favoured in an oxidizing environment.
