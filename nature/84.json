Those points are:\u20141st, The possibility in a comparatively cloudless sky of a luminosity akin to that represented under the name of the corona on page 370 of the number of NATURE issued on March 9, but caused only by moisture in our atmosphere, as illustrated by his instance of what he termed a lunar halo; 2ndly, The presence of a luminosity on what he apprehends should have been the dark disc of the moon, as represented in the photograph of the American observers at Cadiz; 3rdly, The indifferent definition of the published photograph; and 4thly, The evidence as presented by the photograph of the identity of the coronal rifts. Referring to the first of these points, Mr. Brothers \u201cfails altogether to see the connection between the solar corona and a lunar halo.\u201d If the term halo, as applied to any appearance pertaining to the moon, is confined to the ring of light so frequently to be observed apparently surrounding the lunar disc, the writer would substitute the word \u201cluminosity\u201d for halo. The appearance he alluded to resembles Mr. Brothers's woodcuts of the corona already mentioned, more than anything else to which he can compare it, and in common phraseology may be described as a patch of light surrounding the apparent position of the moon, extending from it to a distance varying from about one degree to two or two and a-half, and having an irregular or rifted outline. The phenomenon in question was observed by the writer when the atmosphere was in such a condition that no trace of cloud whatever was visible for a distance round the moon of some thirty or forty degrees. He mentions this merely to show that even when no visible condensation of moisture is present, an appearance\u2014attributable to nothing but atmospheric moisture, and analogous to what is termed the solar corona\u2014is not to be regarded as out of the common, and nothing to be wondered at. Touching the second point, Mr. Brothers would seem to be of opinion that a solar corona may be seen even when the dark disc of the moon intervenes between it and the observer's eye; for he says of the luminosity in question that if caused by our atmosphere it would extend all round and all over that disc. The point at issue here is a very simple optical question, in the discussion of which space would be merely wasted, and in reference to which the writer would simply reiterate the opinion he has already expressed, that the luminous appearance as seen extending on to the disc of the moon in the Cadiz photograph, is (if it were visible outside the camera) attributable to nothing but the influence of the terrestrial, or of a lunar atmosphere. Whilst speaking of the American observer's picture, he would remark in answer to two observations by Mr. Brothers, first, that he is not in \u201cpossession of exclusive information\u201d concerning the circumstances of its production; and secondly, that he does not assume that it was taken under conditions less favourable than those prevailing at Syracuse. He does, however, assume that that photograph either represents only the phenomenon to which the instrument used in its production was directed, or that it represents something in addition to that phenomenon. If its representation is confined to the phenomenon, then upon the grounds already shown, he considers that what is called the coronal light in the Cadiz picture not only may be, but most certainly is, in part at any rate, merely the result of atmospheric moisture. If, however, the American observers were unfortunate enough to represent in their photograph a luminosity not belonging to the eclipse at all, then he considers that what did belong to the eclipse is not distinguishable in their picture from what did not. In short, whether the Cadiz picture does or does not represent only what it should do, the writer is of opinion that any evidence it can afford respecting the identity of the coronal rifts must be other than satisfactorily conclusive.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"4","prism.number":"87","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"160","prism.endingPage":"160","prism.copyright":"1871 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/004160a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/004160a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/004160a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/004160a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Eclipse Photographs","citation_volume":"4","citation_issue":"87","citation_publication_date":"1871/06","citation_firstpage":"160","citation_lastpage":"160","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/004160a0","DOI":"10.1038/004160a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/004160a0","description":"IN his letter published in NATURE on the 1st of June, and to which Mr. Brothers courteously replies in your issue of the 15th, the writer briefly touched upon four different points bearing on the value of the eclipse photographs.

It was about the size of a common hand-ball, its centre being of an exceedingly brilliant white colour, surrounded by a circle of a bluish tinge, while short flickering radiations were distinctly visible on its circumference in all directions, reminding me of the sphero-stellate spicul\u00e6 of certain sponges. It was falling in a perpendicular direction, but I was not fortunate enough to see it at the beginning of its course.

It was about the size of a common hand-ball, its centre being of an exceedingly brilliant white colour, surrounded by a circle of a bluish tinge, while short flickering radiations were distinctly visible on its circumference in all directions, reminding me of the sphero-stellate spicul\u00e6 of certain sponges. It was falling in a perpendicular direction, but I was not fortunate enough to see it at the beginning of its course. Its downward motion was slow and quite gradual, apparently not swifter than an ordinary india-rubber ball would fall by the gravity of its own body.

The same seems to me the case in walking. When we sway the body out of the perpendicular in turning a corner, I am at a loss to understand how this can be performed involuntarily. The explanation seems to me to be that consciousness cannot, so to speak, work so fast as volition, and therefore cannot take cognizance of a large number of rapidly successive acts of the will. The question is not so much one of a nice metaphysical distinction as simply of a correct use of terms, although I am afraid I am opposing the views of such high authorities as Huxley and Carpenter. We have been made familiar with the term Unconscious Cerebration.

These muscles are entirely under the control of the will; and every separate motion of them must surely be effected by a distinct voluntary effort, of which however we are entirely unconscious. The same seems to me the case in walking. When we sway the body out of the perpendicular in turning a corner, I am at a loss to understand how this can be performed involuntarily. The explanation seems to me to be that consciousness cannot, so to speak, work so fast as volition, and therefore cannot take cognizance of a large number of rapidly successive acts of the will. The question is not so much one of a nice metaphysical distinction as simply of a correct use of terms, although I am afraid I am opposing the views of such high authorities as Huxley and Carpenter. We have been made familiar with the term Unconscious Cerebration. Is there not also an enormous field of Unconscious Volition?","dc.creator":["BENNETT, ALFRED W."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["BENNETT, ALFRED W."],"citation_author_institution":["London"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Consciousness and Volition","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Consciousness and Volition&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"006532a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

On the continent the extreme irritation caused by the hairs of Cnethocampa processionea is well known; and the introduction of a brood of these larv\u00e6 into a drawing-room would probably be followed by effects similar to those caused by the king's \u201cgreat flea\u201d in Faust.","dc.creator":["MCLACHLAN, ROBERT"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["MCLACHLAN, ROBERT"],"citation_author_institution":["Lewisham"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Venomous Caterpillars","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Venomous Caterpillars&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"008107a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

R. Lankester, the Savilian Professor is also spoken of as having \u201cdiscovered the sexuality of plants.\u201d It would interest students of the history of botany to know to what extent the writer of either of these articles is able to corroborate this statement by reference to Sir Thomas Millington's writings. In his recently published \u201cHistory of Botany,\u201d Prof. Sachs gives the following account of this alleged discovery:\u2014\u201cIn all histories relating to the subject of sexuality, a certain Sir Thomas Millington\u2014otherwise unknown in the history of botany\u2014is mentioned as deserving of the credit of having first indicated the stamens as the male sexual organs. The only information, however, which we have in support of this is contained in the following statement by Grew in his \u2018Anatomy of Plants,\u2019 1682, p. 171, ch. 5, \u00a7.3:\u2014\u2018In conversation on this subject\u2019\u2014viz., on the part played by the stamens (termed by Grew the \u2018attire\u2019) in the formation of seeds\u2014\u2018with our learned Savilian Professor, Sir Thomas Millington, he gave it as his opinion that the \u2018attire\u2019 serves as the male organ for the production of the seed. I at once replied that I was of the same opinion, gave him some reasons for it, and answered some objections which might be made to it.\u2019\u201d* In the first edition of Grew's work, 1671, he attributes no sexual function to the stamens; but in the edition of 1681 he thus continues, in substance:\u2014It appears firstly, that the \u201cattire\u201d serves to separate certain superfluous portions of the sap in order to prepare for the production of the seed. Just as the foliature (floral leaves) serves to carry away the volatile saline particles of sulphur, so the \u201cattire\u201d serves to diminish and adjust the atmospheric portions, in order that the seed may become more oily and its principles better fixed. The flowers have therefore usually a more powerful odour than the \u201cattire,\u201d because the saline is stronger than the atmospheric sulphur, which is too subtle to affect the senses. An analogy drawn from the animal kingdom follows, which is hardly quotable; but Sachs points out how wonderfully any germ of truth in Grew's hypothesis was corrupted by the chemical theories and strivings after a false analogy of the day. It is difficult to see that there was really any advance in this hypothesis upon the state of knowledge in the time of Theophrastus (B.C. 371\u2013286), who distinctly recognised some individual plants as male, others as female. Whatever merit also is due to Millington must, unless there is other record of his services, be at least equally shared with Grew.\u2020 It does not appear, however, that either of these botanists even attempted to confirm their conclusions by experiment. The merit of the first discovery of the true function of the stamens is assigned by Prof. Sachs to the German botanist Camerarius, in his \u201cDe sexu plantarum epistola,\u201d published in 1694. This tract closes with an ode, reminding one of Darwin's \u201cLoves of the Plants,\u201d beginning thus\u2014 \u201cNovi canamus regna Cupidinis, Novos amores, gaudia non prius Audita plantarum, latentes Igniculos, Veneremque miram.\u201d","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"13","prism.number":"318","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"85","prism.endingPage":"86","prism.copyright":"1875 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/013085e0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/013085e0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/013085e0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/013085e0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Sir Thomas Millington and the Sexuality of Plants","citation_volume":"13","citation_issue":"318","citation_publication_date":"1875/12","citation_firstpage":"85","citation_lastpage":"86","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/013085e0","DOI":"10.1038/013085e0","citation_doi":"10.1038/013085e0","description":"IN your article last week on the Oxford Botanic Garden, reference is made to Sir Thomas Millington, the Savilian Professor of Botany, as having in 1676 \u201cfirst divined the fundamental fact of sexual reproduction in flowering plants.\u201d In a review in the columns of the Academy, of the English edition of Sachs's \u201cText-book of Botany,\u201d by Prof. E.

J. Murphy states the difficulty which he finds in accounting for the rise of intermittent variations upon the theory of natural selection. He can understand the origin of a white species from a brown one or vice vers\u00e2, but not of a species which, like the ermine, is at one season brown and at another season white. He speaks of \u201cfacts of colour which it seems impossible for natural selection to produce, from the infinite improbability of a first variation ever occurring.\u201d From this mode of expression one might fancy that Mr. Murphy had for the moment forgotten that natural selection is in no way concerned with producing, but acts only by preserving, variations. As in a great number of instances we are ignorant of the precise antecedents which produce variation, whether chronic or recurrent, in such instances, we must be left at liberty, if we choose, to invoke the special action of \u201ca guiding intelligence.\u201d The case, however, of an animal which changes its colour with the season does not seem to be one of very exceptional difficulty. It is only necessary to suppose that the animal became possessed of pigments liable to be acted on in the required direction by the seasonal changes of light and heat. It might well be that with some animals the influence of the same changes would be in a direction just the opposite of what was useful to them. In that case the variety would stand but little chance of being preserved. Similar explanations hold with regard to the vegetable kingdom. I have now before me drawings of Sempervivum spinosum. The summer rosette is bright green in colour, with the leaves expanded, while the winter rosette is a compact little ball of a dull purple. Thus the plant prepares itself against the cold of winter and the dearth of nourishment which that season brings, but it is likely enough that cold and dearth in the first instance led to the variation in the plant from its summer habit.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"14","prism.number":"355","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"330","prism.endingPage":"330","prism.copyright":"1876 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/014330a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/014330a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/014330a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/014330a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"[Letters to Editor]","citation_volume":"14","citation_issue":"355","citation_publication_date":"1876/08","citation_firstpage":"330","citation_lastpage":"330","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/014330a0","DOI":"10.1038/014330a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/014330a0","description":"IN the last number of NATURE Mr. J.

W. Thomson gives an interesting account of the \u201cstone-rivers\u201d of the Falkland Islands in a recent number of NATURE (vol. xv. p. 359), and attributes their origin to a general movement of the \u201csoil-cap.\u201d Nothing can be clearer than his explanation of the mode in which the quartzites weather and break up on the hill-slopes, and one can quite understand how the resultant d\u00e9bris is gradually brought down into the valleys by the agents of change he refers to. But it is hard to see how these agents, after having got the d\u00e9bris down into the valleys, can subsequently spread it out into wide sheets, reaching \u201cfrom a few yards to a mile or so in width,\u201d and resembling at a distance glaciers that seem as if descending from the adjacent ridges. The stones, as Mr. Darwin tells us, \u201care not thrown together into irregular piles, but are spread out into level sheets or great streams.\u201d Sir C. W. Thomson is apparently of opinion that these great streams of stones move en masse down the valleys, as \u201cearth-glaciers,\u201d and he refers to the occurrence in Scotland of certain phenomena which seem to him to indicate similar movements of the \u201csoil-cap.\u201d Geologists who have worked much in hilly countries, will readily recognise the truth of his descriptions\u2014indeed the appearances to which he calls attention are quite common in such districts as the Northern Highlands and Southern Uplands of Scotland. The soil and rock-rubbish which are found resting upon our hill-slopes, and the bending-over of the truncated ends of the underlying vertical or highly-inclined strata are of course the results of atmospheric action. Rain or thawing snow filters into joints and crevices, and insinuates itself between bedding-planes, and frost tends to force these apart\u2014the loosened rock moving in the line of least resistance, that is, down hill. At the same time both solid rock and detached fragments \u201cweather,\u201d and thus grit and soil gradually form, while in like manner this gradually-forming \u201csoil-cap\u201d being itself acted upon by frost, is forced in the same way to move down the slope, a movement which is of course aided by a vis a tergo, the weight of the descending mass. Partly in this way, and partly by the direct action of rain, which not only washes the particles down, carrying away surface after surface, but sometimes soaks the loose \u201csoil-cap\u201d to such a degree as to cause the entire accumulation to \u201cflow,\u201d whole hill-sides become swathed in mantles of soil and d\u00e9bris. But it is difficult to believe that an experienced observer would be puzzled to discriminate between such rubbish heaps and true glacial moraines. Arrived at the foot of the slope, the rock-rubbish accumulates there, unless there be some stream at hand to denude it, and to sweep its materials, in the form of gravel, sand, and mud, down the valley. There are many good grounds, however, for believing that much of that \u201csurface-wash\u201d of soil and rock-rubbish which cloaks our hill-slopes to a depth sometimes of many feet, dates back to a time when our climate was considerably colder than it is at present, and that, while it was accumulating, local glaciers occupied many of our mountain-valleys. Putting aside \u201cscrees\u201d and d\u00e9bris-slopes generally, I must say I have never seen any indication of that movement en masse of the soil-cap upon which Sir Wyville insists; and I hardly think many geologists will agree with him that it is \u201calmost self-evident that wherever there is a slope, be it ever so gentle, the soil-cap must be in motion, be the motion ever so slow; and that it is dragging over the surface of the rock beneath the blocks and boulders which may be embedded in it,\u201d &c. Soil, as we all know, is always travelling from higher to lower levels, but this movement consists for the most part in the mere sweeping downwards of its component particles by rain and surface-drainage. It is true that the expansive power of frost, and the action of vegetation as described by Sir Wyville, may force a certain proportion of a soil-cap en masse down a gentle slope, but these influences will affect only an inconsiderable stratum; and, besides, the movement thus caused will be so trifling that the mere surface-action of rain would suffice to carry away the whole soil, particle by particle, long before the power of frost could have moved it bodily more than an inch or two. In reading the accounts of the wonderful \u201cstreams of stones\u201d in the Falkland Islands, one is strongly reminded of the great moving masses of d\u00e9bris in certain valleys of the Rocky Mountains, as described by Dr. Hayden, and to surmise that the stone-rivers of the Falkland Islands may possibly be of the same nature. Dr. Hayden tells us that entire valleys are \u201ccovered thickly with earth, filled with more or less worn rocks of every size, from that of a pea to several feet in diameter. The snow melting upon the crests of the mountains, saturates these superficial earths with water, and they slowly move down the gulch much like a glacier. This is another process of grinding the underlying rocks, smoothing, and grooving them.\u201d But he apparentlysfinds no difficulty in distinguishing between such \u201cearth-glaciers,\u201d and bhe moraines left by those gigantic ice-rivers, which, according to trim, flowed down the valleys of the Rocky Mountains during the glacial period. Suppose now that owing to some change of climate these earth-glaciers were no longer to be saturated with water to such an extent as to cause them to flow en masse, it is evident that the. loose soil of which they are partly composed would then be gradually removed by the action of rain and running water, while the angular blocks and d\u00e9bris would remain for a very much longer time, until eventually they crumbled down and were carried away in the form of gravel, sand, and mud. As far as one can judge from descriptions, the \u201cstone-rivers\u201d of the Falkland Islands seem to present very much the appearance which such dessicated earth-glaciers might be expected to assume, after their finer materials have been abstracted. The possibility that considerable masses of loose materials, such as a \u201csoil-cap,\u201d may have moved en masse, has before now attracted the attention of some observers, Mr. Robert Mallet contributed a paper on the subject a number of years ago to the Journal of the Dublin Geological Society (see vol. v.); and in the fahrbuch der k.k. geologischen Reichsanstalt, vol. xxii. p. 309, will be found an article by Theodor Fuchs, treating of the same subject.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"15","prism.number":"384","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"397","prism.endingPage":"398","prism.copyright":"1877 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/015397b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/015397b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/015397b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/015397b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"\u201cThe Movement of the Soil-cap\u201d","citation_volume":"15","citation_issue":"384","citation_publication_date":"1877/03","citation_firstpage":"397","citation_lastpage":"398","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/015397b0","DOI":"10.1038/015397b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/015397b0","description":"UNDER the above heading Sir C.

It is true that the expansive power of frost, and the action of vegetation as described by Sir Wyville, may force a certain proportion of a soil-cap en masse down a gentle slope, but these influences will affect only an inconsiderable stratum; and, besides, the movement thus caused will be so trifling that the mere surface-action of rain would suffice to carry away the whole soil, particle by particle, long before the power of frost could have moved it bodily more than an inch or two. In reading the accounts of the wonderful \u201cstreams of stones\u201d in the Falkland Islands, one is strongly reminded of the great moving masses of d\u00e9bris in certain valleys of the Rocky Mountains, as described by Dr. Hayden, and to surmise that the stone-rivers of the Falkland Islands may possibly be of the same nature. Dr. Hayden tells us that entire valleys are \u201ccovered thickly with earth, filled with more or less worn rocks of every size, from that of a pea to several feet in diameter. The snow melting upon the crests of the mountains, saturates these superficial earths with water, and they slowly move down the gulch much like a glacier. This is another process of grinding the underlying rocks, smoothing, and grooving them.\u201d But he apparentlysfinds no difficulty in distinguishing between such \u201cearth-glaciers,\u201d and bhe moraines left by those gigantic ice-rivers, which, according to trim, flowed down the valleys of the Rocky Mountains during the glacial period. Suppose now that owing to some change of climate these earth-glaciers were no longer to be saturated with water to such an extent as to cause them to flow en masse, it is evident that the. loose soil of which they are partly composed would then be gradually removed by the action of rain and running water, while the angular blocks and d\u00e9bris would remain for a very much longer time, until eventually they crumbled down and were carried away in the form of gravel, sand, and mud. As far as one can judge from descriptions, the \u201cstone-rivers\u201d of the Falkland Islands seem to present very much the appearance which such dessicated earth-glaciers might be expected to assume, after their finer materials have been abstracted. The possibility that considerable masses of loose materials, such as a \u201csoil-cap,\u201d may have moved en masse, has before now attracted the attention of some observers, Mr. Robert Mallet contributed a paper on the subject a number of years ago to the Journal of the Dublin Geological Society (see vol. v.); and in the fahrbuch der k.k. geologischen Reichsanstalt, vol. xxii. p. 309, will be found an article by Theodor Fuchs, treating of the same subject.","dc.creator":["GEIKIE, JAMES"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["GEIKIE, JAMES"],"citation_author_institution":["Geol.

This, however, requires a fixed and special telephone. The following method of attracting attention requires neither. I venture to send it you, as I have seen no notice of any one having tried it; but I can scarcely believe it to be the case, as the thing would suggest itself to any one studying the instrument.

An allied insect, Drilus flavescens, somewhat rare in this country, and not luminous, is, so far as the female is concerned, seldom found excepting inside the shells of species of Helix the animal of which it had previously devoured.","dc.creator":["MCLACHLAN, R."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["MCLACHLAN, R."],"citation_author_institution":["Lewisham"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Glow-worms v.

I pointed out that whenever fresh water reaches the rock salt it dissolves it.

This brine has of late been extensively pumped up, and many of these extensive cavities had become nearly empty. The thin crust of rock salt forming the roof of these old mines had become gradually thinner, owing to its solution by water, and on Monday morning the roof of one pit gave way, and let the superincumbent earth down into the mine, rifting and opening the ground to the surface. The surface rift passed across the bed of a large brook, and the water of the brook ran through the crevice into the mines below. In a short time the water made a more extensive cavity, and as the brook was cut in two about 200 yards above its entrance into a large lake that was drained by the Weaver River, the water in the lower portion of the brook and of the lake, as well as of the Weaver, commenced to return and run down the enlarged cavity. For four or five hours this return stream increased in velocity, pouring down the crater-like hole. Notwithstanding the water of the brook and the return water, as well as a large body of water from another small lake entering this cavity, the water standing in the funnel-shaped hole gradually lowered. The velocity of both portions of the brook increased, and such was the force of the water that the bottom of the brook for 100 yards was scooped out from 2 feet in depth to 10 feet, and the banks were washed away, making the brook from 30 to 40 feet wide instead of 20 as at first.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"23","prism.number":"581","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"144","prism.endingPage":"145","prism.copyright":"1880 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/023144c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/023144c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/023144c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/023144c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Landslips","citation_volume":"23","citation_issue":"581","citation_publication_date":"1880/12","citation_firstpage":"144","citation_lastpage":"145","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/023144c0","DOI":"10.1038/023144c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/023144c0","description":"IN NATURE, vol. xxii. p. 560, I pointed out that landslips often occurred in the Salt Districts.

In a short time the water made a more extensive cavity, and as the brook was cut in two about 200 yards above its entrance into a large lake that was drained by the Weaver River, the water in the lower portion of the brook and of the lake, as well as of the Weaver, commenced to return and run down the enlarged cavity. For four or five hours this return stream increased in velocity, pouring down the crater-like hole. Notwithstanding the water of the brook and the return water, as well as a large body of water from another small lake entering this cavity, the water standing in the funnel-shaped hole gradually lowered. The velocity of both portions of the brook increased, and such was the force of the water that the bottom of the brook for 100 yards was scooped out from 2 feet in depth to 10 feet, and the banks were washed away, making the brook from 30 to 40 feet wide instead of 20 as at first.","dc.creator":["WARD, THOS."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["WARD, THOS."],"citation_author_institution":["Northwich"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Landslips","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Landslips&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"023195b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

J. Stillman calls attention (NATURE, vol. xxiv. p. 260), finds an obvious explanation in the well-known optical phenomenon of diffraction rings, produced when a beam of light is transmitted through a small circular aperture, and viewed by means of a lens. Had your \u201cCecropian\u201d correspondent examined the image of the illuminated opening by the assistance of a lens, the phenomenon of concentric coloured rings would, doubtless, have been recognisable to the eye.

J. Stillman calls attention (NATURE, vol. xxiv. p. 260), finds an obvious explanation in the well-known optical phenomenon of diffraction rings, produced when a beam of light is transmitted through a small circular aperture, and viewed by means of a lens. Had your \u201cCecropian\u201d correspondent examined the image of the illuminated opening by the assistance of a lens, the phenomenon of concentric coloured rings would, doubtless, have been recognisable to the eye. Hence the only point of interest in the phenomenon observed by Mr. Stillman is the significant fact that in securing the fleeting images of the rings on the gelatine plate\u2014the actinic rays being alone effective\u2014alternate dark and bright concentric rings are produced, as in the case of homogeneous or monochromatic light, instead of the coloured, rings seen by interposing a lens between the aperture and the eye.

Last year my gardener hived a swarm of bees, which were not however satisfied with their new hive, their scouts having probably already selected some hollow tree for their future habitation. They accordingly left, but were soon again secured. In order, if possible, to prevent their deserting the new hive, I placed the queen in a queen-cage (a small perforated metal box with circular holes of the diameter of an ordinary pin's head), which I fixed to the roof inside the hive. A few days afterwards there were several honeycombs in the hive, and in most of the cells eggs had been deposited. Now there could be only three ways of accounting for these eggs in the cells: there might have been more than one queen in the swarm, or there might have been an egg-laying neuter among them, or else the eggs must have been those of the imprisoned queen. Accordingly I several times examined the swarm and the honeycombs (the hive being a frame hive), and satisfied myself that there was no other queen in the swarm. The queen was kept in the cage until some of the larv\u00e6 had come to maturity, the bees of course feeding her through the holes of the cage, and I found that the young bees were neuters, and not drones as they would have been if the eggs had been laid by a neuter. The only explanation, therefore, of the presence of the eggs in the cells was that they had been laid or passed by the queen through the holes of the cage, and taken up and deposited in the cells of some of the workers. This performance showed so much sagacity on the part of the bees, especially the mother bee, that I subsequently repeated the experiment with eight other swarms, and in two instances there was an exactly similar result. Two of the six remaining swarms were so dissatisfied with the new hives offered to them that they refused to build any comb, and ultimately deserted the hive, leaving the caged queen behind, although I was quite satisfied that neither swarm had a second queen among their number. I may here remark that it is much more difficult to retain a swarm of Cape bees in an artificial hive selected for them than appears to be the case in Europe or America, the explanation perhaps being that they are not sufficiently domesticated, and prefer being queenless in a natural hive selected by themselves to remaining with their imprisoned queen in a hive they do not approve of. It is possible of course that the two swarms which left their queen behind may have joined some other occupied hives or may have returned to their own former hive; but I may state that on each occasion I had removed the hives from which the swarms had issued to a considerable distance from their former position. The four remaining swarms upon which I experimented were satisfied with their new hives and built combs, but no eggs were found deposited in the cells. One of these swarms had an imported fertile Italian queen; the second and third had Cape queens, and the fourth had an Italian queen, the progeny of the imported one; the three first began laying in the cells soon after being released, but the fourth never laid eggs at all. As to the last of these queens, I fear she was rather roughly handled when caught, and that this may explain her not laying at all; but I may add that I have not yet succeeded in obtaining queens proved to be fertile from among the progeny of imported Italian queens. There are very few Italian drones in the colony, or at all events in the neighbourhood of Cape Town, and if the Cape drone does not cross with the Italian queen this would be a sufficient explanation of my failure. While upon this subject I may state that we have a yellow bee in South Africa somewhat resembling the Italian, but the neuters are a little smaller. They more closely resemble the Egyptian bees, judging by the descriptions I have read of the latter; but some of their habits are different, for they have only one queen in a hive, and they gather and use propolis, which the Egyptians are said not to do. But most of our Cape bees rather resemble the English bee, although considerably smaller, and the rings of their abdomen are of a lighter brown colour, and I confess till a few years ago I was not aware that we had any other variety. To my surprise, however, about three years ago a swarm of the yellow-winged bees arrived at my place. At first I took them to be Italians, but I had not yet then imported any myself, nor have I since been able to discover that any one else had done so. The queen and drones were exactly like the Italian queen and drones, but the neuters were a little shorter and more slender. I have unfortunately not secured any fresh swarms from the one which I hived, but the neuters that are now in the hive cannot be distinguished from the ordinary Cape worker. There are not at present any drones in the hive, and, as the hive has no frames, it is difficult (without first driving the swarm) to discover whether the queen, now in the hive, has the same appearance as the one which originally arrived. Strangely enough I continually find drones of the yellow variety in hives of the ordinary Cape brown bee. I sometimes, but rarely, see yellow workers visiting my flowers and fruit, and on a recent visit to Natal I saw numbers of bees visiting a sugar store in Durban, all of which were of the yellow variety. I was not sufficiently long in Natal to be able to say whether there are any of the ordinary Cape bees in that colony, but in the Transvaal I have seen both varieties in the fields.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"28","prism.number":"705","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"5","prism.endingPage":"6","prism.copyright":"1883 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/028005b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/028005b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/028005b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/028005b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Cape Bees and \u201cAnimal Intelligence\u201d","citation_volume":"28","citation_issue":"705","citation_publication_date":"1883/05","citation_firstpage":"5","citation_lastpage":"6","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/028005b0","DOI":"10.1038/028005b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/028005b0","description":"I KEEP a large number of hives, chiefly of Cape bees, and find that their habits closely resemble those of European honeybees; but in the course of my observations I have met with an instance of sagacity on the part of Cape bees, which, although it may also have been observed with regard to European or American bees, has not, so far as I am aware, been recorded in any treatise upon the subject.

It is well known that over-exposure (solarisation, as we used to call it formerly) produces such an alteration in the sensitive preparation of the photographic plate that the over-exposed parts cease to be developable, so that a very strong line may appear white in the negative where it ought to be black, but with a dark border, and so give the appearance of a reversed line.

I was so fortunate as to see lately identically the same effect produced with remarkable beauty and completeness in broad daylight from the summit of a Welsh hill. Staying last week for a couple of days at Pen-y-Gwryd, near Snowdon, in company with a friend, we walked one morning up the Glydr-Vach. The rain was steadily descending as we left the little inn, and the thick mist swathed the hill-sides in obliterating folds. Just as we reached the summit at noon a slight breeze thinned away the mist in front of the sun, and a burst of sunshine illuminated the hill-tops. Clambering on to the natural cairn which crowns the summit, we looked down into the valley, in which lies the small lake Llyn Idwal.

We waved our arms, and the mystic figures replied by waving theirs. Surrounding these immense shadowy figures we could see two concentric rainbows completely circular, the centre being the shadow of our heads. The colours of the inner rainbow were in the order of the primary bow, and the outer was a secondary and more faintly-tinted rainbow.

That the vegetable soil had been formed as he states seemed to have been accepted by his followers without hesitation. In your columns, however, of late, letters have appeared from Messrs. R. M. Christy and T. E. Wilcox, showing that earthworms do not exist in the prairies in the north-west of Canada or in the United States, in those of Kansas, the Indian Territory, or in Idaho and Washington Territory. This is simply what may be expected. Notwithstanding the keenness of observation of Darwin and his width of observation, there seem vast regions where earthworms have had little to do with the formation of the vegetable soil. In many parts of Australia, and also in the moister climate of New Zealand, the soil affords few indications that earthworms ever passed it through their bodies. In a section of soil I brought from the Mataura plain, South Island of New Zealand, nothing could be seen to indicate that worms had ever swallowed it. That vegetable soil forms a fit habitation for earthworms is undoubted. Darwin admits \u201cthat a layer, though a thin one, of fine earth, which probably long retains some moisture, is in all cases necessary for their existence.\u201d Before this thin layer existed, how could they\u2014the worms\u2014form vegetable soil? This thin layer must have been formed in some other way; Darwin does not say how. It is not necessary to call in the aid of earthworms to do so. The very name which has been universally applied to the thin upper covering, the exterior film enveloping the surface of the deposits underneath, viz. vegetable soil, speaks to its origin in the decay of vegetation. Take for instance the boulder-clays of this part of the Lothians in Scotland, with their tough, stony texture, their pebbles as finely striated as when the ice squeezed them into the pasty mass of crushed shales out of which they appear to have been partly formed. While these surfaces could have afforded none of the conditions required by Darwin, or indeed supply any other save inorganic food, the slow growth on their surfaces of the more simple forms of vegetable life, and their decay, would in the lapse of ages supply the thin film which Darwin requires.

That the vegetable soil had been formed as he states seemed to have been accepted by his followers without hesitation. In your columns, however, of late, letters have appeared from Messrs. R. M. Christy and T. E. Wilcox, showing that earthworms do not exist in the prairies in the north-west of Canada or in the United States, in those of Kansas, the Indian Territory, or in Idaho and Washington Territory. This is simply what may be expected. Notwithstanding the keenness of observation of Darwin and his width of observation, there seem vast regions where earthworms have had little to do with the formation of the vegetable soil. In many parts of Australia, and also in the moister climate of New Zealand, the soil affords few indications that earthworms ever passed it through their bodies. In a section of soil I brought from the Mataura plain, South Island of New Zealand, nothing could be seen to indicate that worms had ever swallowed it. That vegetable soil forms a fit habitation for earthworms is undoubted. Darwin admits \u201cthat a layer, though a thin one, of fine earth, which probably long retains some moisture, is in all cases necessary for their existence.\u201d Before this thin layer existed, how could they\u2014the worms\u2014form vegetable soil? This thin layer must have been formed in some other way; Darwin does not say how. It is not necessary to call in the aid of earthworms to do so. The very name which has been universally applied to the thin upper covering, the exterior film enveloping the surface of the deposits underneath, viz. vegetable soil, speaks to its origin in the decay of vegetation. Take for instance the boulder-clays of this part of the Lothians in Scotland, with their tough, stony texture, their pebbles as finely striated as when the ice squeezed them into the pasty mass of crushed shales out of which they appear to have been partly formed. While these surfaces could have afforded none of the conditions required by Darwin, or indeed supply any other save inorganic food, the slow growth on their surfaces of the more simple forms of vegetable life, and their decay, would in the lapse of ages supply the thin film which Darwin requires. It surely, then, is attempting too much to ascribe to the earthworm the formation of the vegetable soil. The earthworm is not the only occupant of the material which the growth and decay of vegetation supplies as a surface covering. The earthworm is not the only drainer. The roots of many plants not only descend deeply into the subsoils, but also fetch up from depths where worms could not reach supplies of material to mix with the superficial covering; and so do the various insects which have their habitat in the soil, burrowing as they go, and casting, like the mole, the stuff behind them or upwards as they descend.","dc.creator":["MELVIN, JAMES"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["MELVIN, JAMES"],"citation_author_institution":["Bonnington, Midlothian"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Earthworms","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Earthworms&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"030057b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The cause that led to its deposition over a former land surface was indubitably a great though gradual depression of that area. The process commenced with the Neocomian age, when two seas encroached from north and south, until they were probably only separated by some relativelyunimportant ridges or islands to the north of London. The depression seems to have been checked for a long period, but recommenced in the Gault age in a more serious manner. Now, according to Renard and Murray, the Blue Mud, with which I assume the Gault is to be identified, if with anything, is formed around shores and in partially inclosed seas, passing into a true deep-sea deposit at a distance from land. The limits of depth at which Blue Mud is formed are not stated, but the Mollusca of the Gault, if not indicating a very great depth, are quite against its being a very shallow-water formation. There are several deep-water genera, such as Ne\u00e6ra, Leda, Limopsis, Cadulus, Dentalium, Eulima, in it, and I believe that when the smaller Mollusca from it have been reinvestigated by the light of our present knowledge, a far greater similarity between them and deep-water forms will be apparent. The Gault also contains a very large number of Foraminifera and several Encrinites and other Echinoderms, which are not, I believe, characteristic of long-shore deposits; while there is a remarkable absence in it of the more distinctly shallow-water shells that abound in the Neocomian, and it has none of the coarser fragments of rock, 2 cm. in diameter, which are stated in Renard and Murray's paper to occur in the near-shore muds. We must assume a considerable depth of water for the Lower Gault\u2014what depth I would be well pleased to leave to Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys to say. Now, if there is one fact more apparent than another, it is that the Upper Gault represents a deeper sea than the Lower, and therefore that the depression was maintained. The Blue Mud is replaced in neighbouring areas by Green Muds and Sands with Glauconitic grains which apparently are deposited in similar depths or situations; but the limit of depth at which either the one or the other is dredged is not stated. A still continued depression takes us through Green Mud to the Chalk Marl, which apparently is a true Globigerina ooze1; and this passes into a true White Chalk. The White Chalk is the result of still farther depression, for it overlaps the other deposits, and as the great change in the character of the sediment cannot have been due to the shallowing of the sea, and yet must have had a cause, we must conclude it was due to deepening. Its enormous extent and thickness and great purity proclaim it in fact to be an oceanic deposit, and there does not appear to be anything with which it can be compared except Globigerina ooze.2 The White Chalk of England could therefore only have been deposited under the conditions of depth, or remoteness from land under which the deposit of Globigerina ooze is possible. If Globigerina ooze is not a \u201cterrigenous\u201d deposit, Chalk is not, and it does seem singular that it should be classed as such by Renard and Murray, unless indeed they are prepared to point to an area in which a similar terrigenous formation is taking place at the present day. If genera now confined to shallow-water are present in it, it only proves that there must have been deep-water representatives of those genera in the Cretaceous ocean. This is in fact probable from at least two considerations, the one that the examination of the abyssal fauna is still relatively \u201cextremely slight and cursory,\u201d as Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys has so amply admitted in the address he refers me to. It is probable that thousands of casts of the dredge have been made in the littoral zone for one in the abyssal zone, and we are, therefore, not in a position yet to say that any genus may not have representatives in the latter. The second consideration is far more important. Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys states that \u201call of them (the Cretaceous Mollusca) are evidently tropical forms.\u201d Now there is strong evidence from the present distribution, and the deposition of the Chalk, that the sea did not communicate with Arctic seas. Prof. Prestwich, in his anniversary address to the Geological Society, pointed this out in 1871. But even if it had, the Arctic climate during the Cretaceous period was a warm one, and for these two reasons, or either of them, the abyssal depths of the Chalk ocean were probably higher in temperature than they are now, while the temperature of the more littoral zones may have been almost tropical. Heat and cold seem greater factors in the distribution of Mollusca than depth of water. Relatively cold-loving genera or species of genera that could only have found the necessary temperatures then at great depths, may now find suitable habitats in shallow water. The \u201ctropical Mollusca\u201d of the Chalk might for this reason have been able to live at much greater depths when such were warmer, but are of necessity now restricted to those in which suitable temperatures are to be met with; and since these are now all relatively shallow, Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys may be quite right in saying that these extinct species have a shallow-water facies, without our being obliged to accept his inference that the Chalk sea was a shallow one. But if we accept the Mollusca pure and simple as a test of depth, their evidence as adduced is untrustworthy owing to the association together of those of the Gray Chalk and the Irish Chalk band of Kilcorrig. Eliminating these, we have no patelloid shell left but Hipponyx, and the Chalk species was completely different in habit to anything living. I do not know the Chalk Chama (if the Irish form, this is a limpet) or Pinna, and these must be very rare and even possibly drifted shells. The unextinct characteristic genera are in fact reduced to Terebratula, Lima, Pecten, Armussium, and Spondylus, and of these all but the latter are stated, in the address I am referred to, to have been met with in water 1450 fathoms deep.3","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"30","prism.number":"768","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"264","prism.endingPage":"265","prism.copyright":"1884 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/030264b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/030264b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/030264b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/030264b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Chalk and the \u201cOrigin and Distribution of Deep-Sea Deposits\u201d","citation_volume":"30","citation_issue":"768","citation_publication_date":"1884/07","citation_firstpage":"264","citation_lastpage":"265","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/030264b0","DOI":"10.1038/030264b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/030264b0","description":"IN consequence of Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys' letter, I feel it incumbent, in the interests of geology, to restate the position with regard to the question of the depth of the ocean in which the White Chalk of England was deposited.

A still continued depression takes us through Green Mud to the Chalk Marl, which apparently is a true Globigerina ooze1; and this passes into a true White Chalk. The White Chalk is the result of still farther depression, for it overlaps the other deposits, and as the great change in the character of the sediment cannot have been due to the shallowing of the sea, and yet must have had a cause, we must conclude it was due to deepening. Its enormous extent and thickness and great purity proclaim it in fact to be an oceanic deposit, and there does not appear to be anything with which it can be compared except Globigerina ooze.2 The White Chalk of England could therefore only have been deposited under the conditions of depth, or remoteness from land under which the deposit of Globigerina ooze is possible. If Globigerina ooze is not a \u201cterrigenous\u201d deposit, Chalk is not, and it does seem singular that it should be classed as such by Renard and Murray, unless indeed they are prepared to point to an area in which a similar terrigenous formation is taking place at the present day. If genera now confined to shallow-water are present in it, it only proves that there must have been deep-water representatives of those genera in the Cretaceous ocean. This is in fact probable from at least two considerations, the one that the examination of the abyssal fauna is still relatively \u201cextremely slight and cursory,\u201d as Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys has so amply admitted in the address he refers me to. It is probable that thousands of casts of the dredge have been made in the littoral zone for one in the abyssal zone, and we are, therefore, not in a position yet to say that any genus may not have representatives in the latter. The second consideration is far more important. Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys states that \u201call of them (the Cretaceous Mollusca) are evidently tropical forms.\u201d Now there is strong evidence from the present distribution, and the deposition of the Chalk, that the sea did not communicate with Arctic seas. Prof. Prestwich, in his anniversary address to the Geological Society, pointed this out in 1871. But even if it had, the Arctic climate during the Cretaceous period was a warm one, and for these two reasons, or either of them, the abyssal depths of the Chalk ocean were probably higher in temperature than they are now, while the temperature of the more littoral zones may have been almost tropical. Heat and cold seem greater factors in the distribution of Mollusca than depth of water. Relatively cold-loving genera or species of genera that could only have found the necessary temperatures then at great depths, may now find suitable habitats in shallow water. The \u201ctropical Mollusca\u201d of the Chalk might for this reason have been able to live at much greater depths when such were warmer, but are of necessity now restricted to those in which suitable temperatures are to be met with; and since these are now all relatively shallow, Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys may be quite right in saying that these extinct species have a shallow-water facies, without our being obliged to accept his inference that the Chalk sea was a shallow one. But if we accept the Mollusca pure and simple as a test of depth, their evidence as adduced is untrustworthy owing to the association together of those of the Gray Chalk and the Irish Chalk band of Kilcorrig. Eliminating these, we have no patelloid shell left but Hipponyx, and the Chalk species was completely different in habit to anything living. I do not know the Chalk Chama (if the Irish form, this is a limpet) or Pinna, and these must be very rare and even possibly drifted shells. The unextinct characteristic genera are in fact reduced to Terebratula, Lima, Pecten, Armussium, and Spondylus, and of these all but the latter are stated, in the address I am referred to, to have been met with in water 1450 fathoms deep.3","dc.creator":["GARDNER, J.

It was seen for the first time at 7.45, and then consisted of diffused and faint arches high on the northern sky. By degrees its sphere extended, and at 8.30 it reached the zenith. In this position\u2014from the northern horizon to zenith\u2014the phenomenon remained almost uninterrupted all the following time. The light was rather feeble, and in the beginning the motions were insignificant. But at 10 o'clock the peculiar blazing or undulating movement that is designated by the name of coruscation, began to be seen, and during four hours and a half at least the whole northern half of the sky was the theatre of this uncommonly violent chase of the luminous clouds.

It was seen for the first time at 7.45, and then consisted of diffused and faint arches high on the northern sky. By degrees its sphere extended, and at 8.30 it reached the zenith. In this position\u2014from the northern horizon to zenith\u2014the phenomenon remained almost uninterrupted all the following time. The light was rather feeble, and in the beginning the motions were insignificant. But at 10 o'clock the peculiar blazing or undulating movement that is designated by the name of coruscation, began to be seen, and during four hours and a half at least the whole northern half of the sky was the theatre of this uncommonly violent chase of the luminous clouds. The culmination of the aurora happened at 10.30, when on the northern sky advanced a series of splendid streamers, the inferior points of which played in red and green. This radiance was only of short duration, and later there appeared in the north only arches more or less distinct; while on the higher parts of the heavens the chasing flames incessantly continued their playing.

About the end of August 1885, I was watching a coolie underbushing in the bush on the Demerara River, Demerara, when suddenly a large labaria snake raised his head with open mouth just in front of the coolie. The man struck at it with his cutlass (a knife about twenty inches long), and afterwards assured me that he hit the snake, but I saw the reptile glide off towards the river. I pursued, but without success, the snake having doubtless taken advantage of the river as a means of escape. The coolie, who was a thorough bushman, having been born and brought up in the bush, told me that in all probability there would be another labaria not far off, as they always went in pairs. Next after-noon I heard that William, the coolie, had encountered another laharia, which he had killed. On my going to the place where he was at work, he told me he had buried the snake after cutting off the head. I may here state that a bushman almost invariably buries a snake after killing it, interring the head in a separate grave from the body. This the bushman does because, he says, if any one puts his foot on a snake's skeleton and a bone pierces the skin, the result will be nearly akin to the bite of the snake. This common belief among the sons of the forest has no doubt a good deal of truth in it, especially if a bone be broken in the wound. The interment of the head in a separate grave is merely done as a graphic assurance that the snake can never come to life again. Being curious to know if this labaria was the one I had seen on the previous day, I made William dig the reptile up, and was pleased to find it altogether a much thicker and shorter snake. On recounting his narrow escape from a bite, William vented his spleen by giving the snake's body a hack with his cutlass, when, to my astonishment, out through the wound came seven young ones, varying from five to ten inches in length, as nearly as I could guess. They were all quite lively, although covered with a sort of thin film or saliva. The largest of the brood seemed quite determined on business straight off, so I rapped him over the neck with the back of my knife. We killed the whole lot of them, and William carefully buried them, remarking that the bite of the young was quite as bad as the bite of the old snake. Now these snakes had been buried at a depth of eight or ten inches for from sixteen to eighteen hours, and on liberation did not seem a whit the worse for their entombment. William told me that when he saw the snake first it was lying coiled up fast asleep, and that he had nearly put his foot right on top of it; he, however, cut a stick and killed it before it awoke. We both agreed that from the appearance of the snake she had shed her skin only a few days before. This in all probability was the case, as I found a shed skin about three yards from where she had been killed. The little snakes seemed to me to be inside the stomach, and not in the gullet as Mr. Middleton suggests. The mother also was in a place where there was scarcely any likelihood of her ever having been disturbed to cause her to swallow her brood, and it will be evident that the young did not quickly perish even after the mother was dead. From what has just been stated, would it not be reasonable to advance the theory that the mother snake swallows the young ones alter they are hatched, and retains them in her stomach until they attain a development that fits them to take care of themselves, when she either vomits them up, or they wriggle out of her mouth of their own free will?","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"33","prism.number":"847","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"269","prism.endingPage":"269","prism.copyright":"1886 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/033269d0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/033269d0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/033269d0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/033269d0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Viper and its Young","citation_volume":"33","citation_issue":"847","citation_publication_date":"1886/01","citation_firstpage":"269","citation_lastpage":"269","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/033269d0","DOI":"10.1038/033269d0","citation_doi":"10.1038/033269d0","description":"I WAS very much interested in an account of a viper swallowing its young, given in NATURE a short time ago, and would like to corroborate the statement of Mr. Middleton's correspondent, anent this extraordinary performance, by relating as briefly as possible a little incident of which I was a witness.

H. Hodd in last week's NATURE (p. 53) of the numerical proportion of the sexes of Mr. Poulton's race of extra-toed cats, in relation to the recurrence of the abnormity, is very interesting as an inferrable deduction from the premises of Mr. Poulton's elaborate tabulation of his observations; but it is, I think, doubtful whether it is not misleading as a generalisation from the facts collected by him. A conclusion arrived at by means of a mathematical method is too absolute an inference, and not necessarily reliable, when applied to purely biological cases, on account of the numerous intervening factors (perhaps mostly unknown, but yet of importance) which are incapable of being appreciated within such an estimate, and which may, in consequence, invalidate the main point under consideration. This appears to be the case on the present occasion; for Mr. Poulton mentions, in describing the kittens of VIII5 (p. 39), that by far the most highly specialised development of the abnormity he has observed, throughout the entire race, was attained in a male\u2014VIII5. Considering that the large majority of individuals possessing the character are of the sex, as pointed out by Mr. Hodd, this fact is really very striking. But, at the same time, if the point alluded to by Mr. Hodd were considered as amounting to a principle, we should naturally be led to infer that, the abnormity might become equivalent to a secondary sexual character, which is so improbable that it scarcely bears suggestion. Besides, it is necessary to bear in mind that all the observations carried on as yet by Mr. Poulton have dealt with the \u2640 influence alone; and it may be accounted for by the very reason that all the \u2642s have been carefully eliminated from exercising any influence on the race, that the predominant effect, numerically, is on the \u2640 side; while it is most probable that if an abnormal \u2642 were selected (say, the individual just referred to) as a starting-point for experiment with normal \u2640s, the result would exhibit a general tendency towards superior persistence of the character operating with greater potency amongst the males than the females.

MURRAY's concise explanation of the formation of coral reefs and islands presents advantages in more than one respect. It demands no a priori assumptions, but begins and ends with that which can be observed, while Darwin's theory requires the preliminary concession of subsidence, which never has been and never perhaps can be observed. It must appear ungracious to question a theory that accords so completely with the natural history of coral islands, but even this theory requires a geological concession, and that is stability. Coral islands, it may be supposed, after all only differ from other oceanic islands in being crusted over with coral, so that we cannot see their original state, and the question is whether we can grant such long periods of stability to them, from our experience of other oceanic islands, which are free from coral and can therefore be observed. Nearly all oceanic islands are volcanic, and it is probable that their elevation coincides more or less with the period of volcanic activity somewhere along their line. It is obvious that coral islands are not formed during this phase, because no theory would then hold good; the peaks would grow through and carry up the coral, which might leave only such small traces of its existence as we find in a single spot in Madeira. It would not be unreasonable to suppose that if the expansive and elevating force were withdrawn the peaks would slowly subside, and that if there are some lines of elevation, there must be others of subsidence, unless the earth is as a whole growing in bulk. Darwin claims the existence of areas of subsidence, and that these are eminently favourable to coral growth, and it is quite apparent that if the Island of Madeira were to sink, as it has undoubtedly risen, its last appearance in a coral sea would be as an atoll. We shall never see the interior structure of a stationary or subsiding coral island, and can only look for a re-elevated example with a crust that has been protected from solution whilst dead and submerged, and yet not sufficiently so to mask the core.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"39","prism.number":"1010","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"435","prism.endingPage":"436","prism.copyright":"1889 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/039435c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/039435c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/039435c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/039435c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Origin of Coral Islands","citation_volume":"39","citation_issue":"1010","citation_publication_date":"1889/03","citation_firstpage":"435","citation_lastpage":"436","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/039435c0","DOI":"10.1038/039435c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/039435c0","description":"MR.

We found that if the two sides of the receiver be connected with a delicate galvanometer, it is affected whenever a spark passes. It is not so easy to get sparks to pass when the galvanometer is so connected as when the receiver is insulated; but whenever a spark passes, the galvanometer\u2014a 7000-ohm Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company's pattern\u2014is deflected through several degrees and often off the scale.

In cases (1) and (2) of your correspondent, viz. approach or recession of observer, source and medium being at rest, the correct formula is and in cases (3) and (4), viz. approach and recession of source, observer and medium at rest, it is, n\u2032 = the new, and n the old frequency of vibration of the note heard. It should be remarked, however, that in all practical cases, the two formul\u00e6 give very nearly the same result; but if the velocity v is very great, the case is entirely different. Suppose, for instance, in cases (1) and (2) that v = velocity of sound a, then n\u2032 = 2n for approach, and O for recession of the observer. The correctness of these results is obvious without the aid of any formula. Again, in cases (3) and (4) suppose v = a, then n\u2032 = \u221e for approach, and  for recession of the source of sound. The effect of an infinite number of waves striking the ear at the same moment would be simply that nothing would be heard. It would be interesting to notice the change in pitch of the whistle of a rifle-bullet passing near an observer. Ganot's formula is correct for cases (1) and (2), and Prof. Everett's for cases (3) and (4); the proofs are very simple, and may be easily thought out. When the observer and the source of sound both move, the two formul\u00e6 should be applied separately when a, very accurate result is desired. These conclusions have been confirmed by Dr. Fison, of University College. I had not considered the effect of the motion of the medium, but it appears to me, after a little reflection, that this would increase or diminish the velocity of the sound, and the wave-length, in the same proportion, leaving the pitch unaltered; the velocity of the medium should therefore be added to or subtracted from a in the formula.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"42","prism.number":"1072","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"54","prism.endingPage":"54","prism.copyright":"1890 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/042054b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/042054b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/042054b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/042054b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Doppler's Principle","citation_volume":"42","citation_issue":"1072","citation_publication_date":"1890/05","citation_firstpage":"54","citation_lastpage":"54","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/042054b0","DOI":"10.1038/042054b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/042054b0","description":"IN answer to a correspondent who has met with a difficulty in the consideration of Doppler's principle, I may say that I think I fairly solved the difficulty in a paper delivered last year before the University College Chemical and Physical Society.

The result, curious at the time, has received a new interest from a later observation. The nursery maid who had charge of the boy did not understand a word of English, Italian being the language spoken with the domestics exclusively. The first articulations of the child were evidently meaningless mimicry of what he heard from us, and it had so much the character of English speech that the maid supposed he was speaking English. There was no attempt to catch or repeat any word\u2014only a gabble, a gibberish, in which we were not able to detect any resemblance to any word of any language. This continued for several weeks, when we perceived that he began to repeat certain sounds to which we found that he attached definite meaning, and as this progressed he left off his incoherent imitation of our language, and he soon had coined a small vocabulary for himself, comprising words for bread, water, milk, &c. The first word we distinguished was as nearly as I can render it \u201cbhumbhoo,\u201d meaning water. This phase continued some weeks also, when he began to couple our words for his objects with his own\u2014as \u201cbumbhoo-aqua,\u201d when he wanted water.

The result, curious at the time, has received a new interest from a later observation. The nursery maid who had charge of the boy did not understand a word of English, Italian being the language spoken with the domestics exclusively. The first articulations of the child were evidently meaningless mimicry of what he heard from us, and it had so much the character of English speech that the maid supposed he was speaking English. There was no attempt to catch or repeat any word\u2014only a gabble, a gibberish, in which we were not able to detect any resemblance to any word of any language. This continued for several weeks, when we perceived that he began to repeat certain sounds to which we found that he attached definite meaning, and as this progressed he left off his incoherent imitation of our language, and he soon had coined a small vocabulary for himself, comprising words for bread, water, milk, &c. The first word we distinguished was as nearly as I can render it \u201cbhumbhoo,\u201d meaning water. This phase continued some weeks also, when he began to couple our words for his objects with his own\u2014as \u201cbumbhoo-aqua,\u201d when he wanted water. Little by little he dropped his own words and began speaking only Italian. The three stages of the development of language were perfectly distinguishable, but I supposed that the words the child contrived were purely arbitrary, and am inclined to think so still; but during a late visit to Greece I went over to Crete, and visiting in the family of an old Cretan friend, I was interested in a little boy\u2014his young son\u2014who was in the state of development of speech which I have noted in ours as the second.

I must leave it to others to decide what value can be attached to the statements of a writer who adopts the principle of appropriating an argument, and putting it forward in a manner which would lead most readers to consider that he had been the first to elaborate it simply because he has expressed the same idea in abstract symbols instead of in concrete terms.","dc.creator":["MELDOLA, R."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["MELDOLA, R."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Co-adaptation","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Co-adaptation&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"044124b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

That on September 9 was very fine, flickering streamers and arches forming at intervals from 8 o'clock to 10 o'clock p.m. A peculiar feature of this aurora was an arch similar to that described in NATURE of September 17 (vol. xliv. p. 475), as having been seen by Mr. Tuckwell at Loughrigg, Ambleside, on September 11. The arch seen at Lyons on September 9 was visible shortly after sunset, and remained in the same position throughout the evening. It consisted of a narrow band of light, which arose vertically from a point on the horizon nearly due west, and passed through the constellations of the Northern Crown and the Lyre, and just south of the zenith down to the eastern horizon.

That on September 9 was very fine, flickering streamers and arches forming at intervals from 8 o'clock to 10 o'clock p.m. A peculiar feature of this aurora was an arch similar to that described in NATURE of September 17 (vol. xliv. p. 475), as having been seen by Mr. Tuckwell at Loughrigg, Ambleside, on September 11. The arch seen at Lyons on September 9 was visible shortly after sunset, and remained in the same position throughout the evening. It consisted of a narrow band of light, which arose vertically from a point on the horizon nearly due west, and passed through the constellations of the Northern Crown and the Lyre, and just south of the zenith down to the eastern horizon. When it was brightest, at about 10 p.m., a few small streamers formed in connection with it nearly in the zenith; otherwise it consisted simply of a narrow band of white light separated by a wide interval from the auroral coruscations and streamers in the northern heavens.

Anyhow, it will be seen that there is no general agreement about the expressions \u201cphysiological psychology\u201d and \u201cpsycho-physics,\u201d such as Dr. Titchener's note suggests.","dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Physiological Psychology and Psycho-physics","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Physiological Psychology and Psycho-physics&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"049554e0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The barbarous and cruel treatment of these Indians by their Spanish conquerors, so rapidly decreased their numbers, that in 1655, the date of the conquest of the island by the English, it is probable that not a single specimen of the original type of inhabitant remained alive. Very little was left-behind as a record that ever such a race existed here. A few pieces of earthenware showing very primitive ornamentation, and a few flint implements and beads, are practically all that remain to represent their arts and manufactures. Parts of the interior of the country are formed of Miocene limestone, and in this, many caves are to be found. Most of them have, however, yielded little of interest.

The barbarous and cruel treatment of these Indians by their Spanish conquerors, so rapidly decreased their numbers, that in 1655, the date of the conquest of the island by the English, it is probable that not a single specimen of the original type of inhabitant remained alive. Very little was left-behind as a record that ever such a race existed here. A few pieces of earthenware showing very primitive ornamentation, and a few flint implements and beads, are practically all that remain to represent their arts and manufactures. Parts of the interior of the country are formed of Miocene limestone, and in this, many caves are to be found. Most of them have, however, yielded little of interest. In one, at Pedro Bluff, the only two aboriginal skulls hitherto known were found. These were submitted to Sir William Flower, and show a frontal compression with corresponding lateral expansion, a deformation produced artifically during infancy by the former inhabitants of the West Indian islands.

He has forwarded to me a few worms collected in Macquarie Island, which lies to the south of New Zealand, about half-way between it and the land of the southern continent. These belong partly to the almost worldwide Pachydrilus, and one species\u2014a new one\u2014is referable to the earthworm genus Acanthodrilus. The importance of this latter species is that it is firstly an Acanthodrilus, and secondly that it is closely allied to a group of Patagonian and South Georgian species of the same genus, and is less like any New Zealand form. It is to me a matter of surprise that Dr. H. O.

I have attempted to rectify this state of affairs in a text-book of zoogeography, lately issued by the Cambridge University Press. In Patagonia and some of the islands immediately to the southward, only two genera of indigenous earthworms, so far as is known at present, exist. These are Acanthodrilus and Microscolex.

In Kerguelen and Marion Islands but one species of earthworms has been found, which is an Acanthodrilus. In New Zealand there are nine species of Acanthodrilus, also six species belonging to genera that are very nearly akin to Acanthodrilus, and three species of Microscolex. The remaining six species of Microscolex are South and Central American to the extent of four, while the two remaining are from Tenerife and Algeria. Of Acanthodrilus, the only species left, after deducting those already enumerated, are one from the Cape of Good Hope, one from New Caledonia, and three from Western and North Australia.

Phys. Soc., Mr. \u201cG. H. B.,\u201d after quoting Wroblewski's paper \u201cDie Zusammendr\u00fcckbarkeit des Wasserstoffes\u201d (Wiener Sitzb., 1889), says (referring to my paper \u201cOn the Critical Temperature of Hydrogen,\u201d Bull. Acad. Cracovie, March 1895): \u201cNatanson does not appear to have made any fresh experiments on the subject, and the conclusions arrived at in his paper are therefore not results of independent original investigation.\u201d It is difficult to understand the right Mr. \u201cG. H. B.\u201d has to ignore the professedly theoretical character of my paper. To blame a writer offering theoretical deductions on the account of his not having made \u201cfresh experiments,\u201d is surely a criticism of extraordinary character. Wroblewski's critical data are not in the least the outcome of direct experiment, but have been calculated from an empirical equation, constructed to represent Wroblewski's compressibility curves. My reasoning and calculation are utterly different, being founded upon Van der Waals' law of thermodynamic correspondence.

Phys. Soc., Mr. \u201cG. H. B.,\u201d after quoting Wroblewski's paper \u201cDie Zusammendr\u00fcckbarkeit des Wasserstoffes\u201d (Wiener Sitzb., 1889), says (referring to my paper \u201cOn the Critical Temperature of Hydrogen,\u201d Bull. Acad. Cracovie, March 1895): \u201cNatanson does not appear to have made any fresh experiments on the subject, and the conclusions arrived at in his paper are therefore not results of independent original investigation.\u201d It is difficult to understand the right Mr. \u201cG. H. B.\u201d has to ignore the professedly theoretical character of my paper. To blame a writer offering theoretical deductions on the account of his not having made \u201cfresh experiments,\u201d is surely a criticism of extraordinary character. Wroblewski's critical data are not in the least the outcome of direct experiment, but have been calculated from an empirical equation, constructed to represent Wroblewski's compressibility curves. My reasoning and calculation are utterly different, being founded upon Van der Waals' law of thermodynamic correspondence. Besides, there are other points in my paper, and they have no relation with whatever Wroblewski has written. All this will be seen at once on comparing my paper with that of Wroblewski's. But from Mr. G. H.

On September 6 it had reached a depth of 987 feet, passing through a hard dolomite-like coral rock, apparently similar to that mentioned previously as occurring below about 700 feet. Boring in the bed of the lagoon from the deck of H.M.S. Porpoise had been continued; the one mentioned in your last number was carried through sand, composed of fragments of calcareous organisms in which broken pieces of coral became commoner in descending, to a depth of 144 feet in the bed-rock of the lagoon, or in all 245 feet below sea-level. There progress was stopped by hard coral rock, which could not be pierced, because the great length of unsupported pipe (about 120 feet) made driving impossible, and the loose stuff above prevented them from applying another device. Captain Sturdee, though unable to stay much longer at the island, contrived to move the Porpoise about 90 feet nearer to the centre of the lagoon, where another boring was made at about the same depth. This was carried through 80 feet of sand, as before, which was then succeeded by a rather hard coral gravel; the lumps varying up to the size of a man's fist. It was pierced to a depth of 33 feet, when the time limit was reached, and the work was necessarily abandoned. The results, however, are most interesting, and our friends in Sydney may be congratulated on the success of boring so far in a depth of a hundred feet of water. When letters left the island the main bore was still progressing, though the supply of diamonds was nearly exhausted, so that there seems every hope that it will be carried below a thousand feet.

I strongly suspect that home influences have a good deal to do with the rather exaggerated value for the fraternal correlation in the category of conscientiousness. But certain characters, e.g. the cephalic index after three years of age, the eye-colour between twenty and thirty and the hair-colour from seven to fourteen are but little, in England at any rate, subject to environmental influence. The cephalic index remains almost constant throughout life. Now the mean value for the fraternal correlation for these three characters is 0.5161, and for stature, span, forearm and health, which might be supposed to be largely influenced by environment, it is 0.5179. It thus seemed to me that environment was not an important factor in modifying the correlation of the physical characters between brothers. In other words, environment does not influence the constant uniformly in one direction. This view was apparently appreciated by Prof. Cockerell when he wrote \u201cthe treatment of successive children is not the same.\u201d Any influence of environment, strange as it may seem, was thus found to be negligible. Turning to the intellectual characters, my own a priori conception was that I should for the first time be able to distinguish between nurture and heredity. I expected much higher correlations in the case of temperament and probity than in that of physique. I was therefore somewhat surprised when the values came out much the same as in the case of the physical characters, say an average of 0.5. Of course it is open to Prof. Cockerell to say that 0.3 of this only is due to heredity and 0.2 to environment, or whatever other division appears to him probable, but he will then have to explain why the sum of the two makes 0.5, and why the influence of heredity is less in the intellectual than it appears to be for the physical characters.

I strongly suspect that home influences have a good deal to do with the rather exaggerated value for the fraternal correlation in the category of conscientiousness. But certain characters, e.g. the cephalic index after three years of age, the eye-colour between twenty and thirty and the hair-colour from seven to fourteen are but little, in England at any rate, subject to environmental influence. The cephalic index remains almost constant throughout life. Now the mean value for the fraternal correlation for these three characters is 0.5161, and for stature, span, forearm and health, which might be supposed to be largely influenced by environment, it is 0.5179. It thus seemed to me that environment was not an important factor in modifying the correlation of the physical characters between brothers. In other words, environment does not influence the constant uniformly in one direction. This view was apparently appreciated by Prof. Cockerell when he wrote \u201cthe treatment of successive children is not the same.\u201d Any influence of environment, strange as it may seem, was thus found to be negligible. Turning to the intellectual characters, my own a priori conception was that I should for the first time be able to distinguish between nurture and heredity. I expected much higher correlations in the case of temperament and probity than in that of physique. I was therefore somewhat surprised when the values came out much the same as in the case of the physical characters, say an average of 0.5. Of course it is open to Prof. Cockerell to say that 0.3 of this only is due to heredity and 0.2 to environment, or whatever other division appears to him probable, but he will then have to explain why the sum of the two makes 0.5, and why the influence of heredity is less in the intellectual than it appears to be for the physical characters. There is the obvious direct scientific interpretation which seems to me the true one, environment does not act in one direction in either case, and the mental and physical characters are inherited precisely at the same rate. To those who have taken the trouble, as I have done, to examine carefully the mental characteristics of a family at intervals of a century apart, so that we are not troubled by the co-environment peculiar to brothers, it is needless, perhaps, to urge the very strong inheritance of mental qualities. If Prof. Cockerell attributes it to his third factor, \u201cpre-existing soul,\u201d I should, indeed, be proud to have aided in the demonstration of its reality, although I fail entirely to see how it is to be done \u201cby just such methods as Prof. Pearson employs.\u201d Meanwhile most people will, I think, prefer to stick to heredity.","dc.creator":["PEARSON, KARL"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["PEARSON, KARL"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Inheritance of Mental Characters","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Inheritance of Mental Characters&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"065392b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This is quite intelligible, but when it is said that the child by this means will acquire left-handed skill in all other manipulations, this cannot be correct. Left-handedness means that the left hand can be used equally well with the right; this is true, but not in the same way. The course of the cricket ball in a left-handed bowler is not the usual one. When a surgeon is left-handed it is not to enable him to do with his left exactly the same thing as with the right, but something different. After making an incision in the eye with his right hand, he takes the knife in his left to complete what he requires, without altering his position or turning the patient round. A left-handed waiter, after removing the limbs of the chicken on one side, changes the knife and fork to the other hands, and does the same on the other side. It only wants a moment's consideration to see that if the arms are turned round one goes in the right direction and the other in the left, so that if the right hand is used in turning a screw to the right, as screws are all made, a corresponding movement with the left would turn it in the opposite direction. As left-handed screws are not usually made, a left-handed man has to use a different and inferior set of muscles, and works with a disadvantage. In the same way ordinary handwriting cannot be copied by the corresponding muscular and nerve apparatus on the left side; it is done by a totally different apparatus after much time and trouble. It is much easier to use the corresponding set of muscles, but then this produces backward or mirror writing. The only movements common to the two sides must be near the median line. If the corresponding muscular and nerve apparatus be used in both arms, the result is equally good, but if is not the same, as in writing or turning a screw. If one hand imitates the exact movements of the other, it is done by another apparatus and at a disadvantage, as with a child learning the scale and using different fingers for similar notes.

HILL has recently asked the question, \u201cCan dogs reason?\u201d The following analogy has always appeared to me to be a sufficient reply.

But when Mr. Milne thinks that no one will gainsay the contention, the challenge is a wide one, and I deny it emphatically, and know that there are hundreds of men who will agree with me. These men are not teachers or mathematicians, but those who have to use mathematics for their profession or trade.","dc.creator":["TROTTER, A.

From the deck of a steamer the colony, only the flat disc of which is visible, appears like a floating counter of bone or ivory. When examined at close quarters it has a greyish metallic lustre, and is seen to be surrounded with an aureole of azure tentacles, the tips of which are green. So long ago as 15791 Thomas Stevens appears to have remarked upon this animal (though he did not recognise its animal nature) as being one of the signs by which the vicinity of land might be known on the Indian coasts. During the monsoon, even in comparatively fine weather, this Porpita, so far as my observations go, completely disappears from the surface. It would seem to follow that the colony is an annual growth, as it has no power of sinking, and very feeble, if any, means of independent progression. This is borne out by an observation I was able to make on the shore at Colombo on July 15 last. On that date, when the monsoon had already been in progress for some weeks, the beach along the Galle face, which is open to the full force of the monsoon, was covered with biscuit-like discs, which I had no difficulty in recognising, from the sculpturing on their surface and the characteristic appearance in cross-section, as those of Porpita. They had quite lost their silvery appearance, and were very brittle; no trace of the living tissues of the animal remained.

From the deck of a steamer the colony, only the flat disc of which is visible, appears like a floating counter of bone or ivory. When examined at close quarters it has a greyish metallic lustre, and is seen to be surrounded with an aureole of azure tentacles, the tips of which are green.

The rate of discharge of several instruments, carefully made, was found to be about sixty to one hundred times as large as that obtained by Mr. H. L. Cooke two years earlier in the same building. At first it was supposed that the insulation of the sulphur bead was defective. But the natural leak was large and unaffected when the upper support of the sulphur bead was raised to a higher potential than the gold leaf system, so that the insulation was not at fault. Nor was the rate of discharge altered when the electroscope was entirely surrounded by lead one inch thick. Removal to another building produced no effect on the leak of the electroscope. It appeared probable that the trouble was due to the radio-activity of the materials from which the electroscope was made. A rude instrument, made in a private house with a tobacco tin, the amber mouthpiece of a pipe, and a cork, was found to give better results than the most carefully constructed instrument in the physics building. Some electroscopes were next made in the chemistry building, using materials which had never been into the physics building.

The rate of discharge of several instruments, carefully made, was found to be about sixty to one hundred times as large as that obtained by Mr. H. L. Cooke two years earlier in the same building. At first it was supposed that the insulation of the sulphur bead was defective. But the natural leak was large and unaffected when the upper support of the sulphur bead was raised to a higher potential than the gold leaf system, so that the insulation was not at fault. Nor was the rate of discharge altered when the electroscope was entirely surrounded by lead one inch thick. Removal to another building produced no effect on the leak of the electroscope. It appeared probable that the trouble was due to the radio-activity of the materials from which the electroscope was made. A rude instrument, made in a private house with a tobacco tin, the amber mouthpiece of a pipe, and a cork, was found to give better results than the most carefully constructed instrument in the physics building. Some electroscopes were next made in the chemistry building, using materials which had never been into the physics building. Instruments with a very slow rate of discharge were now easily manufactured. These were used to test materials from various parts of the physics building, and it was found that all were infected with excited activity. Sheets of mica, lead foil, iron, zinc and tin were all active, even when taken from drawers or cupboards.","dc.creator":["EVE, A.

Scotia, 1913\u201d, on the above subject, referred to in NATURE of January 14, will, I fear, be a great disappointment to many after the great promise given by the new line of investigation discovered by Prof. H. T. Barnes, of Montreal University. Prof. Barnes found, by means of a very sensitive registering thermometer, that there was always a rise in temperature of the sea on approaching icebergs, and part of the Scotia's work was to check this observation. The Scotia was fitted with two sensitive registering thermometers, one to be used for trawling near the surface; the other was placed in a box through which the condenser water for the engine was pumped.

Scotia, 1913\u201d, on the above subject, referred to in NATURE of January 14, will, I fear, be a great disappointment to many after the great promise given by the new line of investigation discovered by Prof. H. T. Barnes, of Montreal University. Prof. Barnes found, by means of a very sensitive registering thermometer, that there was always a rise in temperature of the sea on approaching icebergs, and part of the Scotia's work was to check this observation. The Scotia was fitted with two sensitive registering thermometers, one to be used for trawling near the surface; the other was placed in a box through which the condenser water for the engine was pumped. Unfortunately, both these instruments soon became defective owing to sea water leaking into them. The one used for surface temperatures was repaired on the voyage, but the other does not seem to have been restored to working condition. The result is that all the temperatures taken with the recording instrument are surface temperatures taken at a depth of 2 ft.","dc.creator":["AITKEN, JOHN"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["AITKEN, JOHN"],"citation_author_institution":["Ardenlea, Falkirk"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Influence of Icebergs on the Temperature of...","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Influence of Icebergs on the Temperature of the Sea&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"094589b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It is most interesting reading to anyone, but particularly to those like myself who spent many years on the Eastern Frontier among the tribes mentioned. This book covers so large an area, goes back so far into the past history of Assam since the East India Company were brought into relation with that country, and further back into a lost history of its ancient greatness, that 256 pages cannot do the subject justice.

This book covers so large an area, goes back so far into the past history of Assam since the East India Company were brought into relation with that country, and further back into a lost history of its ancient greatness, that 256 pages cannot do the subject justice.

The tubes contained 15 c.c. of 1 per cent, agar gel, in which small quantities of either liver of sulphur or manganese sulphate had been dissolved, and were treated with 10 c.c. of a standard solution of the other reagent. Particularly in the case of the gels containing the polysulphides, the resulting stratification differed from that hitherto observed, in that many of the zones were separated into a number of concretions, which in some instances were joined by rods to those of the succeeding zone. The concretions were all sharply defined; the indistinctness of Fig. 2 is due to their being imbedded in the gel.

The tubes contained 15 c.c. of 1 per cent, agar gel, in which small quantities of either liver of sulphur or manganese sulphate had been dissolved, and were treated with 10 c.c. of a standard solution of the other reagent. Particularly in the case of the gels containing the polysulphides, the resulting stratification differed from that hitherto observed, in that many of the zones were separated into a number of concretions, which in some instances were joined by rods to those of the succeeding zone. The concretions were all sharply defined; the indistinctness of Fig. 2 is due to their being imbedded in the gel. The peculiar structure may be due to the presence in the gel of small nuclei in the shape of deposited sulphur, or possibly to the composite character of one of the solutes. The separate spheroids, once started, would grow by adsorption in the same way as the solid strata.

The British Empire includes within its bounds a larger number and wider range of timbers than any other State; but many of these are imperfectly known, and on that account not in commercial use. Prof. Groom instanced many examples of the need for scientific research in timber. Wood-pulp, the import of which into the United Kingdom was valued at 5,500,000l. in 1913, is obtained at present mainly from spruce growing in foreign countries. In all probability it could be manufactured as cheaply from the soft woods, valueless as timber, which grow abundantly in the forests of our tropical possessions; and an investigation into this problem is most desirable. The hard woods of the tropics, owing to the loose nomenclature and wrong naming of many species, are less sought for than they deserve by architects, railway companies, and other large consumers of strong durable wood.

The British Empire includes within its bounds a larger number and wider range of timbers than any other State; but many of these are imperfectly known, and on that account not in commercial use. Prof. Groom instanced many examples of the need for scientific research in timber. Wood-pulp, the import of which into the United Kingdom was valued at 5,500,000l. in 1913, is obtained at present mainly from spruce growing in foreign countries. In all probability it could be manufactured as cheaply from the soft woods, valueless as timber, which grow abundantly in the forests of our tropical possessions; and an investigation into this problem is most desirable. The hard woods of the tropics, owing to the loose nomenclature and wrong naming of many species, are less sought for than they deserve by architects, railway companies, and other large consumers of strong durable wood. The African mahoganies, for example, comprise a large series of different woods, varying widely in colour, hardness, and other qualities; and the identification and standardisation of these and other tropical woods should be the subject of prolonged scientific investigation.

Genetic association studies have used a variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in the 3\u2032-flanking region of the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) to implicate the DAT in the development of various neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we have examined the possibility that a mutation exists in the coding region of the DAT1 gene which through linkage disequilibrium accounts for the observed associations. The complete coding region, as well as exon\u2013intron boundaries, was screened in 91 unrelated individuals including 45 patients with bipolar affective disorder and 46 healthy control individuals by the means of single strand conformation analysis. Our findings suggest that the DAT1 gene is highly conserved since we detected only two rare missense substitutions (Ala559Val, Glu602Gly) and three silent mutations (242C/T, 1342A/G, and 1859C/T) in the whole coding region. Five sequence variants were observed in intronic sequences but none affects known splice sites. The lack of frequent variants of possible functional relevance indicates that genetic variation in the coding region of the DAT1 gene is not responsible for the previously observed associations with neuropsychiatric disorders. The two rare missense substitutions were found in single bipolar patients but not in controls. Investigation of the patients\u2019 families revealed independent segregation between the Ala559Val variant and affective disorder. The Glu602Gly variant was inherited by the proband from an affected father.

Avariety of models have been proposed1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17, and it seems clear that the occurrence of pentagons, which yield 60\u00b0 disclination defects in the hexagonal graphitic network, is a key element in the puzzle. The problem of nucleation has been complicated by the great variety of structures observed in any one sample. Here we report an unusual carbon sample generated by pyrolysis of hydrocarbons, consisting entirely of graphitic microstructures with total disclinations that are multiples of +60\u00b0.

Avariety of models have been proposed1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17, and it seems clear that the occurrence of pentagons, which yield 60\u00b0 disclination defects in the hexagonal graphitic network, is a key element in the puzzle. The problem of nucleation has been complicated by the great variety of structures observed in any one sample. Here we report an unusual carbon sample generated by pyrolysis of hydrocarbons, consisting entirely of graphitic microstructures with total disclinations that are multiples of +60\u00b0. The disclination of each structure corresponds to the presence of a given number of pentagons in the seed from which it grew: disks (no pentagons), five types of cones (one to five pentagons), of which only one was known previously18, and open tubes (six pentagons).

A primary cause for this pattern is the heterogeneity in the amount of energy, or primary productivity (the rate of carbon fixed through photosynthesis), available to the biota in a given location1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. But the shape of the relationship between productivity and species diversity is highly variable10,11,12,13,14. In many cases, the relationship is \u2018hump-shaped\u2019, where diversity peaks at intermediate productivity7,9,10,12,15,16,17,18. In other cases, diversity increases linearly with productivity4,5,6,10,11,12. A possible reason for this discrepancy is that data are often collected at different spatial scales10,12,14. If the mechanisms that determine species diversity vary with spatial scale, then so would the shape of the productivity\u2013diversity relationship.

A primary cause for this pattern is the heterogeneity in the amount of energy, or primary productivity (the rate of carbon fixed through photosynthesis), available to the biota in a given location1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. But the shape of the relationship between productivity and species diversity is highly variable10,11,12,13,14. In many cases, the relationship is \u2018hump-shaped\u2019, where diversity peaks at intermediate productivity7,9,10,12,15,16,17,18. In other cases, diversity increases linearly with productivity4,5,6,10,11,12. A possible reason for this discrepancy is that data are often collected at different spatial scales10,12,14. If the mechanisms that determine species diversity vary with spatial scale, then so would the shape of the productivity\u2013diversity relationship. Here, we present evidence for scale-dependent productivity\u2013diversity patterns in ponds.

Here we analyse data for over 900 herbivorous species feeding on 51 plant species in New Guinea and show that most herbivorous species feed on several closely related plant species. Because species-rich genera are dominant in tropical floras, monophagous herbivores are probably rare in tropical forests. Furthermore, even between phylogenetically distant hosts, herbivore communities typically shared a third of their species. These results do not support the classical view that the coexistence of herbivorous species in the tropics is a consequence of finely divided plant resources; non-equilibrium models of tropical diversity6 should instead be considered. Low host specificity of tropical herbivores reduces global estimates of arthropod diversity from 31 million (ref. 1) to 4\u20136 million species.

This is important evidence for the existence of large triploblastic metazoans in the Precambrian and indicates that the origin of the higher groups of protostomes lies well back in the Precambrian.","dc.creator":["Fedonkin, Mikhail A.","Waggoner, Benjamin M."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_title=The geology and Late Precambrian fauna of the Ediacara fossil reserve.; citation_inbook_title=Rec.

The observations that mice deficient in E2A1,2 and EBF3 lack B-lineage cells have implicated these two transcription factors in the commitment process. Moreover, the expression of genes encoding components of the rearrangement machinery (RAG1, RAG2, TdT) or pre-B-cell receptor (\u03bb5, VpreB, Ig\u03b1, Ig\u03b2) has been considered to indicate B-lineage commitment4.

The observations that mice deficient in E2A1,2 and EBF3 lack B-lineage cells have implicated these two transcription factors in the commitment process. Moreover, the expression of genes encoding components of the rearrangement machinery (RAG1, RAG2, TdT) or pre-B-cell receptor (\u03bb5, VpreB, Ig\u03b1, Ig\u03b2) has been considered to indicate B-lineage commitment4. All these genes including E2A and EBF are expressed in pro-B cells lacking the transcription factor Pax5 (refs 5,6,7).

Once activated, they proliferate vigorously, generating effector cells that can migrate to B-cell areas or to inflamed tissues3,4,5,6. A fraction of primed T lymphocytes persists as circulating memory cells that can confer protection and give, upon secondary challenge, a qualitatively different and quantitatively enhanced response7,8,9. The nature of the cells that mediate the different facets of immunological memory remains unresolved. Here we show that expression of CCR7, a chemokine receptor that controls homing to secondary lymphoid organs, divides human memory T cells into two functionally distinct subsets.

Once activated, they proliferate vigorously, generating effector cells that can migrate to B-cell areas or to inflamed tissues3,4,5,6. A fraction of primed T lymphocytes persists as circulating memory cells that can confer protection and give, upon secondary challenge, a qualitatively different and quantitatively enhanced response7,8,9. The nature of the cells that mediate the different facets of immunological memory remains unresolved. Here we show that expression of CCR7, a chemokine receptor that controls homing to secondary lymphoid organs, divides human memory T cells into two functionally distinct subsets. CCR7- memory cells express receptors for migration to inflamed tissues and display immediate effector function. In contrast, CCR7+ memory cells express lymph-node homing receptors and lack immediate effector function, but efficiently stimulate dendritic cells and differentiate into CCR7- effector cells upon secondary stimulation.

We conclude that hSlu7 is required to hold exon 1 tightly within the spliceosome for attack on a prespecified AG.","dc.creator":["Chua, Katrin","Reed, Robin"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_title=The RNA World; citation_publication_date=1993; citation_id=CR1; citation_author=MJ Moore; citation_author=CC Query; citation_author=PA Sharp","citation_title=The RNA World; citation_publication_date=1999; citation_id=CR2; citation_author=CB Burge; citation_author=TH Tuschl; citation_author=PA Sharp","citation_journal_title=Cell; citation_title=Mechanical devices of the spliceosome: motors, clocks, springs, and things.; citation_author=JP Staley, C Guthrie; citation_volume=92; citation_publication_date=1998; citation_pages=315-326; citation_doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80925-3; citation_id=CR3","citation_journal_title=RNA; citation_title=The second catalytic step of pre-mRNA splicing.; citation_author=JG Umen, C Guthrie; citation_volume=1; citation_publication_date=1995; citation_pages=869-885; citation_id=CR4","citation_journal_title=EMBO J.; citation_title=Evidence that U5 snRNP recognizes the 3\u2032 splice site for catalytic step II in mammals.; citation_author=MD Chiara, L Palandjian, R Feld Kramer, R Reed; citation_volume=16; citation_publication_date=1997; citation_pages=4746-4759; citation_doi=10.1093/emboj/16.15.4746; citation_id=CR5","citation_journal_title=Mol.

Here we show, using a suspension of yeast cells, that living cells can be kept in a well defined oscillating state indefinitely when starved cells, glucose and cyanide are pumped into a cuvette with outflow of surplus liquid. Our results show that the transitions between stationary and oscillatory behaviour are uniquely described mathematically by the Hopf bifurcation13. This result characterizes the dynamical properties close to the transition point. Our perturbation experiments show that the cells remain strongly coupled very close to the transition. Therefore, the transition takes place in each of the cells and is not a desynchronization phenomenon.

Here we show, using a suspension of yeast cells, that living cells can be kept in a well defined oscillating state indefinitely when starved cells, glucose and cyanide are pumped into a cuvette with outflow of surplus liquid. Our results show that the transitions between stationary and oscillatory behaviour are uniquely described mathematically by the Hopf bifurcation13. This result characterizes the dynamical properties close to the transition point. Our perturbation experiments show that the cells remain strongly coupled very close to the transition. Therefore, the transition takes place in each of the cells and is not a desynchronization phenomenon. With these two observations, a study of the kinetic details of glycolysis, as it actually takes place in a living cell, is possible using experiments designed in the framework of nonlinear dynamics. Acetaldehyde is known to synchronize the oscillations10.

However, resistance to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ, Velcade) is an emerging clinical impediment. Mutations in the \u03b25 subunit of the proteasome, the primary target of BTZ, have been associated with drug resistance. However, the exact mechanism by which these mutations contribute to BTZ resistance, is still largely unknown. Toward this end, we here developed BTZ-resistant multiple myeloma (8226) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CCRF-CEM) cell line models by exposure to stepwise increasing concentrations of BTZ. Characterization of the various BTZ-resistant cells revealed upregulation of mutant \u03b25 subunit of the proteasome. These newly identified \u03b25-subunit mutations, along with previously described mutations, formed a mutation cluster region in the BTZ-binding pocket of the \u03b25 subunit, that of the S1 specificity pocket in particular.

However, resistance to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ, Velcade) is an emerging clinical impediment. Mutations in the \u03b25 subunit of the proteasome, the primary target of BTZ, have been associated with drug resistance. However, the exact mechanism by which these mutations contribute to BTZ resistance, is still largely unknown. Toward this end, we here developed BTZ-resistant multiple myeloma (8226) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CCRF-CEM) cell line models by exposure to stepwise increasing concentrations of BTZ. Characterization of the various BTZ-resistant cells revealed upregulation of mutant \u03b25 subunit of the proteasome. These newly identified \u03b25-subunit mutations, along with previously described mutations, formed a mutation cluster region in the BTZ-binding pocket of the \u03b25 subunit, that of the S1 specificity pocket in particular. Moreover, we provide the first evidence that the mechanism underlying BTZ resistance in these tumor cells is impaired binding of BTZ to the mutant \u03b25 subunit of the proteasome. We propose that proteasome subunit overexpression is an essential compensatory mechanism for the impaired catalytic activity of these mutant proteasomes. Our findings further suggest that second-generation proteasome inhibitors that target the \u03b17 subunit of the proteasome can overcome this drug resistance modality.","dc.creator":["Franke, N E","Niewerth, D","Assaraf, Y G","van Meerloo, J","Vojtekova, K","van Zantwijk, C H","Zweegman, S","Chan, E T","Kirk, C J","Geerke, D P","Schimmer, A D","Kaspers, G J L","Jansen, G","Cloos, J"],"dc.subject":["Medicine/Public Health, general","Internal Medicine","Intensive / Critical Care Medicine","Cancer Research","Oncology","Hematology"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=J Biol Chem;

In this framework, femtosecond laser-written integrated photonic circuits, which have already been assessed for use in quantum information experiments in the 800-nm wavelength range, have great potential. In fact, these circuits, being written in glass, can be perfectly mode-matched at telecom wavelength to the in/out coupling fibers, which is a key requirement for a low-loss processing node in future quantum optical networks. In addition, for several applications, quantum photonic devices must be dynamically reconfigurable.

In this framework, femtosecond laser-written integrated photonic circuits, which have already been assessed for use in quantum information experiments in the 800-nm wavelength range, have great potential. In fact, these circuits, being written in glass, can be perfectly mode-matched at telecom wavelength to the in/out coupling fibers, which is a key requirement for a low-loss processing node in future quantum optical networks. In addition, for several applications, quantum photonic devices must be dynamically reconfigurable. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the high performance of femtosecond laser-written photonic circuits for use in quantum experiments in the telecom band, and we demonstrate the use of thermal shifters, which were also fabricated using the same femtosecond laser, to accurately tune such circuits.

This was achieved using a new dopant material, diphenyl disulphide, which was found to enable a fast, positive refractive index change using a low ultraviolet dose. These changes were investigated and found to arise from photodissociation of the diphenyl disulphide molecule and subsequent molecular reorganization. We demonstrate that gratings inscribed in these fibres can exhibit at least a 15 times higher sensitivity than silica glass fibre, despite their quick inscription times. As a demonstration of the sensitivity, we selected a highly stringent situation, namely, the monitoring of a human heartbeat and respiratory functions. These findings could permit the inscription of fibre Bragg gratings during the fibre drawing process for mass production, allowing cost-effective, single-use, in vivo sensors among other potential uses. Bragg gratings have been written into polymer optical fibres in a few milliseconds, thanks to the use of a new dopant in the fibres\u2019 cores. Fibre Bragg gratings can be quickly inscribed in silica optical fibres, but it takes much longer to inscribe gratings in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) fibres. Julien Bonefacino and co-workers from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University solved this problem by adding diphenyl disulphide to both raise the refractive index of the fibres\u2019 cores and make them highly photosensitive. Using low-fluence ultraviolet light from a helium\u2013cadmium laser, Bragg gratings could be inscribed in only 7\u2009milliseconds\u2014about 140 times faster than previously reported inscription times and short enough to make the scheme potentially compatible with fabrication during fibre drawing.

The identification of AP Lib from the chart given by Bolton et al.3 for PKS 1514\u201324 is confirmed in brightness and in position given in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars4. Bond has pointed out that Searle and Bolton5 have noted that AP Lib has no emission lines between 6500 and 4300 \u00c5 and that Westerlund and Wall6 have classified AP Lib as an N galaxy. This communication attempts to answer the question raised by Biraud concerning the similarity of AP Lib to BL Lac and describes two spectra (0.5 mm wide) of AP Lib obtained on August 16 and 18, 1971, with the 74-inch telescope at Mount Stromlo Observatory. The spectra cover the wavelength range 6800 to 3600 \u00c5 with a resolution of 3 \u00c5 (dispersion 100 \u00c5 mm\u22121) and with exposure times of 60 and 90 min. During both exposures the image of AP Lib was observed to be stellar when the seeing image was less than 1.5 arc s in diameter, supporting the classification of AP Lib as an N-type galaxy. Both spectra of AP Lib are continuous over the wavelength range covered and show no features in emission or absorption stronger than 200 m\u00c5 equivalent width which cannot be ascribed to night sky emissions7. It is apparent from the energy distribution in the continuous spectrum that AP Lib, at the time observed, possesses a marked ultraviolet excess relative to stars of similar blue-visual gradient. This is in agreement with the Westerlund and Wall6 photometry of PKS 1514\u201324.
