This intensity of colour was only very conspicuous during the last few hundred feet of the ascent; and in expeditions to mountains of nearly the same height I have not often seen it approached, never surpassed. Mr. Hincliff in his \u201cSummer Months among the Alps,\u201d p. III, calls attention to the same phenomenon on Monte Rosa, and very appositely quotes Shelley : The sun's unclouded orb Rolled through the black concave.","dc.creator":["BONNEY, T.

The volume of the terrestrial atmosphere is an element which obviously has nothing to do with the question. Atmospheric air, if raised to a temperature of 3,272,000\u00b0 Fah., will expand 6,643 times; hence a vertical column forty-two miles high will reach a, height of 279,006 miles, if brought to the stated temperature. The basis of computation adopted by Captain Ericsson being an area of one square inch, he shows that a medium similar to the terrestrial atmosphere containing an equal quantity of matter for corresponding area, transferred to the solar surface, will, owing to the superior attraction of the sun's mass, exert a pressure of 14.7 X 27.9 = 410 pounds. And that, if the said medium be heated to a mean temperature of 3,272,000\u00b0 Fah., it will expand to a height of 279.006/27.9 = 10,000 miles above the solar surface. But. if a gas composed chiefly of hydrogen 1.4 times heavier than hydrogen the specific gravity of which is 1/14 of that of air, be substituted, the height will be (14 X 10,000)/1.4 = 100,000 miles.

We have no valid reason, therefore, to suppose that any deviation from the ascertained law of expansion takes place in the solar atmosphere, sufficient to alter materially the before-mentioned computations of its depth.","dc.creator":["THULE"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["THULE"],"citation_author_institution":["New York"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Density and Depth of the Solar Atmosphere","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Density and Depth of the Solar Atmosphere&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"005283d0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It refers to the definition of the estimated degree of development of any quality whatever, without reference to external standards of measurement. The scale I propose depends on two processes; the one is securely based on the law of statistical constancy, the other is doubtfully based on the law of frequency of error. (1) At present we are accustomed to deal with averages and the like, which can only be obtained by measuring every individual by a detached standard scale, and going through an arithmetical process afterwards. Now I want to deal with cases for which no external standard exists, and I propose to proceed in quite another way, on the principle that intercomparison suffices to define. We have only to range our group in a long series, beginning with the biggest and ending with the smallest; and then we know by the law of statistical constancy that, the individual who occupies the half-way point, or any other fractional position of the entire length, will be of the same size as the individual who occupies a similar position in any other statistical group of similar objects. We state his size with statistical precision by saying that his place is so and so in a series. We appeal to a standard which lies dormant in every group, and which a statistician can evoke, for temporary purposes of comparison, whenever he will. (2) What places in the series shall we select for our graduations? Equal fractions of its length will never do\u2014I mean such as one-tenth, two-tenths, &c. \u2014because of the great inequality of the variation in diffeient parts of the series, being insensible between those whose position is near its middle and great between those at either end. I propose to use a scale founded on the law of Frequency of Error, which gives a scale of equal parts wherever that law applies, and I use the \u201cprobable error\u201d for the unit of tlie scale. Thus, in a row of a hundred individuals the graduations of + 2\u00b0, + 1\u00b0, 0\u00b0, \u2212 1\u00b0, \u2212 2\u00b0, respectively would be at the following places, in percentages of the length of the series:\u20142, 9, 25, 50, 75, 91, 98. We know that the law of Frequency of Error applies very closely to the linear measurements of the human form. Now suppose that I want to get the average height and \u201cprobable error\u201d of a crowd of savages. Measuring them individually is out of the question; but it is not difficult to range them\u2014roughly for the most part, but more carefully near the middle and one of the quarter points of the series. Then I pick out two men, and two only\u2014the one as near the middle as may be, and the other near the quarter point, and I measure them at leisure. The height of the first man is the average of the whole series, and the difference between him and the other man gives the probable error. The question I put is, whether any more convenient subdivision of a series can be suggested for universal use than that above mentioned. Its merits are, that it applies very fitly to linear measurements of all natural groups; also to errors of observation, which are akin to many of the moral qualities, for the measurement of which the scale is especially needed. It would not apply to weight, but is less out of relation to it than most persons might think, because weights do not vary as the cubes of the heights. Tall men are often thin, and short ones are fat, and the curious fact seems thoroughly verified that the general relation between height and weight is strictly as the squares. (See Gould's \u201cSanitary Memoirs of the War of the Rebellion,\u201d Cambridge, U. S., 1869, p. 408\u2014410.) If we arrange a series and graduate it according to equal differences of the squares of the heights of the men, we are not so far astray as if we had dealt with the cubes.

It refers to the definition of the estimated degree of development of any quality whatever, without reference to external standards of measurement. The scale I propose depends on two processes; the one is securely based on the law of statistical constancy, the other is doubtfully based on the law of frequency of error. (1) At present we are accustomed to deal with averages and the like, which can only be obtained by measuring every individual by a detached standard scale, and going through an arithmetical process afterwards. Now I want to deal with cases for which no external standard exists, and I propose to proceed in quite another way, on the principle that intercomparison suffices to define. We have only to range our group in a long series, beginning with the biggest and ending with the smallest; and then we know by the law of statistical constancy that, the individual who occupies the half-way point, or any other fractional position of the entire length, will be of the same size as the individual who occupies a similar position in any other statistical group of similar objects. We state his size with statistical precision by saying that his place is so and so in a series. We appeal to a standard which lies dormant in every group, and which a statistician can evoke, for temporary purposes of comparison, whenever he will. (2) What places in the series shall we select for our graduations? Equal fractions of its length will never do\u2014I mean such as one-tenth, two-tenths, &c. \u2014because of the great inequality of the variation in diffeient parts of the series, being insensible between those whose position is near its middle and great between those at either end. I propose to use a scale founded on the law of Frequency of Error, which gives a scale of equal parts wherever that law applies, and I use the \u201cprobable error\u201d for the unit of tlie scale. Thus, in a row of a hundred individuals the graduations of + 2\u00b0, + 1\u00b0, 0\u00b0, \u2212 1\u00b0, \u2212 2\u00b0, respectively would be at the following places, in percentages of the length of the series:\u20142, 9, 25, 50, 75, 91, 98. We know that the law of Frequency of Error applies very closely to the linear measurements of the human form. Now suppose that I want to get the average height and \u201cprobable error\u201d of a crowd of savages. Measuring them individually is out of the question; but it is not difficult to range them\u2014roughly for the most part, but more carefully near the middle and one of the quarter points of the series. Then I pick out two men, and two only\u2014the one as near the middle as may be, and the other near the quarter point, and I measure them at leisure. The height of the first man is the average of the whole series, and the difference between him and the other man gives the probable error. The question I put is, whether any more convenient subdivision of a series can be suggested for universal use than that above mentioned. Its merits are, that it applies very fitly to linear measurements of all natural groups; also to errors of observation, which are akin to many of the moral qualities, for the measurement of which the scale is especially needed. It would not apply to weight, but is less out of relation to it than most persons might think, because weights do not vary as the cubes of the heights. Tall men are often thin, and short ones are fat, and the curious fact seems thoroughly verified that the general relation between height and weight is strictly as the squares. (See Gould's \u201cSanitary Memoirs of the War of the Rebellion,\u201d Cambridge, U. S., 1869, p. 408\u2014410.) If we arrange a series and graduate it according to equal differences of the squares of the heights of the men, we are not so far astray as if we had dealt with the cubes. But I cannot imagine any quality, unless possibly music and memory, to vary so rapidly towards the large end of the series as the latter division would show. To sum up: subdivision in equal parts is of no use practically, and is therefore out of the question; the law of error will do very accurately for many large groups of cases; the law of error modified by being brought into relation to bulk will rarely, if ever, be right for other qualities. It therefore seems to me reasonable to adopt the law of error series, as the best compromise, and to accept it as \u201cthe common statistical scale.\u201d If, for example, I estimate a soldier's energy at + 2\u00b0 (S.S.), I state what everybody who cared to inquire into the subject would construe in exactly the same sense as I used the phrase, and he would also be inclined to believe, until better informed, that the difference between such a man's energy and that of a man of + 0\u00b0 (S.S.) was twice as great as between him and a man of + 1\u00b0 (S.S.).","dc.creator":["GALTON, FRANCIS"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["GALTON, FRANCIS"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"On a Proposed Statistical Scale","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;On a Proposed Statistical Scale&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"009363a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In all these cases these colours appear to us to be merely an accidental quality of the chemical products, and we do not feel induced to start the question of what use any particular colour may be to the plant producing it.

There are no indications on the ground which would lead anyone to suspect that either of the outlets had been artificially formed; the general contour of the surrounding country would rather favour the contrary view.","dc.creator":["JEBB, GEORGE R."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["JEBB, GEORGE R."],"citation_author_institution":["Chester"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Lakes with two Outfalls\u2014A Caution","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Lakes with two Outfalls&#8212;A Caution&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"010244a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Many know the toy boomerang made of card-board, \u201cV\u201d shaped, with one limb shorter than the other, say four and two and-a-half inches respectively. When this toy is laid on the smooth cover of a book held at an inclination of about 60\u00b0, and when the shorter limb projecting just beyond the edge of the book is struck with a smart fillip of the finger so as to project it rotating rapidly at an upward angle of 60\u00b0, the toy will reach the further side of a room and return; but of course if it strikes anything its plane of rotation is changed and it falls irregularly.","dc.creator":["HIGGINS, HENRY H."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["HIGGINS, HENRY H."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Boomerang","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Boomerang&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"013286b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

I would gladly show that I have studied them. Though I do not believe in a \u201cglacial period,\u201d I have convinced myself that local glacial climates, like the existing climate of Greenland and the \u201cArctic current\u201d have prevailed in different regions at different times, and that marks of these \u201clocal glacial periods\u201d include \u201cvalleys\u201d of certain forms, with \u201cfirths\u201d and \u201clake basins.\u201d Glaciation occupied the attention of the Geological Society at their last meeting, when Prof. Ramsay read an abstract of a paper, in which a foreign writer compared Greenland and Norway. So far as I understand that writer's views as to glacial action in general, I agree with him. Many writers hold opposite opinions as to \u201cthe usual evidence of powerful ice erosion,\u201d and \u201cthe alleged power of a glacier to excavate a depression in the earth's surface\u201d (Judd), as to \u201cabrasion,\u201d and \u201cthe inability of glaciers to excavate except under peculiarly favourable circumstances\u201d (Bonney). Truth is learned by observation and by perseverance. A drop hollows a stone, not by force, but by frequent falling, and that truth has become proverbial. A stream of water by flowing, and by rolling stones, makes a watercourse, and that truth is proved by every shower and in every gutter. By perseverance flowing water makes a deep watercourse. According to the latest official report of Dr. Hayden (June 4, 1876), streams which began to flow about the sources of the Mississippi, when the Rocky Mountains were raised, have gone on flowing ever since in the same channels, and some have worn ca\u00f1ons \u201cfrom half a mile to a mile deep,\u201d not by force, but by frequent flowing. A glacier also flows. It is acknowledged that it wears and grooves rock, but still it is denied that a wide deep stream of flowing ice can make a wide deep furrow. It is said that ice \u201cabrades,\u201d but does not \u201cerode,\u201d that it cannot \u201cexcavate,\u201d unless under favourable circumstances. It is maintained that flowing ice cannot hollow out a basin, though flowing water does it on a small scale wherever it flows. Much is done by perseverance. As a drop hollows a stone, and water a watercourse, so ice makes an ice-channel slowly; and much repetition by glacialists may in time convince sceptics of that truth. Icebergs are the ends of glaciers pushed out into the sea, and there launched. Some of them are 3,000 feet thick. They prove their size by grounding in soundings off Newfoundland, and Labrador, and Greenland, and by their rate of flotation when they float with 300 feet above water, as \u201cflat-topped islands of ice\u201d in southern seas. A \u201cglacier\u201d cannot easily be measured on shore, but these vagrant fragments roughly measure parent glaciers. A pressure of 3,000, or of 1000, or of 500 feet of ice upon sand or stone moving in an ice-channel is great abrading force. At the base of every ice-fall, or ice-rapid, the plunging ice-river must tend to \u201cexcavate,\u201d because falls and rapids of water excavate pools of various size proportioned to their power. The area of Greenland nearly equals that of India, and that area, so far as it is known, is covered with thick ice which is slowly moving seawards. The coasts are furrowed by deep hollows, of which most contain flowing glaciers, of which many enter the sea, and launch \u201cislands of ice.\u201d Some \u201cbergs\u201d now float to the lowest latitude reached by northern drift stones on shore in Europe and in America. I say nothing here about marine glaciation. The Greenland glaciers are flowing from an area where water generally falls frozen; they flow as rivers now flow from India, and all of them are slowly wearing their channels at some rate, and working up stream like Niagara Falls. There is no measure for the time during which these powerful ice-rivers of Greenland have been slowly hollowing stone by frequent flowing, unless it be the work of erosion done. It is denied that the work was done by the glaciers. Yet no rivers flow where ice fills the dales, and these Greenland dales have been \u201ceroded,\u201d and bear \u201cthe usual evidence of powerful ice erosion,\u201d according to photography and descriptions. According to the clearest marks the whole Scandinavian peninsula, and the whole of Finland have at some lime been covered by ice on the scale of Greenland ice. Sermitualik glacier, photographed by Mr. Bradford before 1870, is near Cape Desolation in Greenland, opposite to Shetland, Bergen, Christiania, St. Petersburg, &c. It is from three and a half to four miles wide where it enters the sea, and there it is about 800 feet thick. It extends inland as far as the eye can reach, and probably comes from the watershed of Greenland. Taking the ice to weigh only 55 Ibs. per foot cube, the pressure above the sea-level on the ice channel is about 44,000 Ibs. on the foot square. Between ice and rock are large stones, grit, and mud; and the rock is rounded where it is visible at the edge of the glacier, near the sea-level. The slopes between the lakes of Finland, and the gulf near Viborg, at the side of the. Saiamea canal, and elsewhere, are polished, striated, and rounded. I took rubbings in September, 1865, and recognised the work of ice on the scale of Greenland ice. In Norway the old marks are plain on the sides of firths and dales, and some lead back to glaciers, which still flow from large areas upon the watershed, which still are covered by considerable sheets of ice. In Greenland this engine is seen at work; in Scandinavia the work of the engine is better seen, That work is, first a rounded worn plateau about the watershed called the \u201cfjeld\u201d second, a series of slopes much glaciated; and third, below these slopes, long grooves hollowed out of the solid, called \u201cdales.\u201d In these dales rivers now flow to lakes and to firths. Of these rivers some have worn deep watercourses, and ca\u00f1ons proportioned to their size and age. At the bottom of the dales are hollows which are called Jakes, and firths when they hold fresh or salt water; in the rivers are smaller pools, which become ponds in dry weather. This northern country opposite to Greenland has been \u201ccarved\u201d in this fashion by ice on the large scale, and afterwards by water-streams, and by the frequent falling of rain drops. It has also risen from the sea. The ice-cover has been taken off Scandinavia and Finland, and there it is possible to test theories about the work which an ice-cover is now doing on the present chief gathering grounds of snow throughout the world. But that Scandinavian work is the same kind of work which is found with small glacial marks elsewhere. Hollows have rounded sections , or when deep they are like . Hills between hollows commonly are hog-backs , and generally the land is rounded, except where peaks rise, and cliffs have broken. But this kind of rounded sculpture exists only in some regions of the world, and it marks the site of local glacial periods, as I believe. Elsewhere the section of valleys is angular like , or in ca\u00f1on countries like . These angular grooves are known to be the work of streams, because every stream of water carves on the same plan. Rounded hills and dales are at first sight evidence of powerful ice erosion, but some kinds of rock weather in bosses. If it be admitted that a drop wears a stone, that a stream makes a deep ca\u00f1on in a long time, and that a glacier \u201cabrades\u201d or makes any mark at all, it seems to follow that an ice-engine as large as India or Scandinavia has in fact done the large work which it might be expected to do by perseverance in working, as it is known to work, wherever snow now gathers in large masses. Given the hardly perceptible wearing of water and time, a ca\u00f1on a mile deep and many hundreds of miles long has resulted from the flowing of a stream. Given glacial \u201cabrasion\u201d and time enough, than valleys of rounded section, and firths and lake-basins of a particular kind probably resulted from the flowing of ice.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"14","prism.number":"350","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"230","prism.endingPage":"231","prism.copyright":"1876 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/014230b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/014230b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/014230b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/014230b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Firths, Dales, and Lakes, Valleys and Ca\u00f1ons","citation_volume":"14","citation_issue":"350","citation_publication_date":"1876/07","citation_firstpage":"230","citation_lastpage":"231","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/014230b0","DOI":"10.1038/014230b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/014230b0","description":"IN NATURE, vol. xiii. p. 481, you honoured me by printing a notice of some writings on glacial subjects, and since then many pamphlets have been sent to me.

Given the hardly perceptible wearing of water and time, a ca\u00f1on a mile deep and many hundreds of miles long has resulted from the flowing of a stream. Given glacial \u201cabrasion\u201d and time enough, than valleys of rounded section, and firths and lake-basins of a particular kind probably resulted from the flowing of ice.","dc.creator":["C., J."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["C., J."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Firths, Dales, and Lakes, Valleys and Ca\u00f1ons","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Firths, Dales, and Lakes, Valleys and Ca&#241;ons&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"014369d0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Mr. Bolton, formerly of Stourbridge and now of 17, Ann Street, Birmingham, sends me weekly supplies of rotifers, and has just sent me Rhinops vitr\u00e6a and Hydatina senta in great profusion. With ordinary compressoria and live boxes these are troublesome to see, as they are very lively rovers. To those who may not know the Midland Naturalist or the Microscopic Transactions, I recommend a particular method which I recently sent to those publications.\u2014Take a plane glass slide, on it drop one or more of the rotifers in a drop of water about half-an-inch in diameter, and draw off the surplus water, if any, carefully with the empty pipette. Then fray out a very very small portion of cotton wool (I always use a watchmaker's glass in the eye to do all such operations) until it is much extended, and spread out and lay this on the drop. Upon that lay the thin microscopic glass, the thinner the better, and then set up the capillary attraction by gently touching it with a needle. Draw off any superfluous water from the edges with the pocket-handkerchief and you will have a little wilderness of wool in which the rotifer is restrained in its movements, protected from pressure, and within reach of very high powers. The amount of wool depends on the size of the rotifer. Hyda tina requires more depth than rhinops. The same plan answers equally well for all roving animals. The podurid\u00e6 in particular when placed in deep glass cells are easily seen by this apparatus, and it saves many a weary and vexatious five minutes with the compressorium, which, even at the best, requires with living animals extraordinary patience. The rotifers are easily found and secured with the pipette and a watchmaker's glass in the eye after a very little practice. Mr. Bolton's studio is of the greatest value to naturalists and cannot be too well known, for to those who have not time to look for specimens it is a great privilege to be able to purchase them.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.publicationDate":"1878-06-01","prism.volume":"18","prism.number":"449","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"141","prism.endingPage":"141","prism.copyright":"1878 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/018141b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/018141b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/018141b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/018141b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Hints to Workers with the Microscope","citation_volume":"18","citation_issue":"449","citation_publication_date":"1878/06","citation_online_date":"1878/06/01","citation_firstpage":"141","citation_lastpage":"141","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/018141b0","DOI":"10.1038/018141b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/018141b0","description":"I AM now and have been for the last fortnight enjoying a treat which everyone who possesses a microscope, a slip of glass to lay on the stage, and a piece of thin microscopic glass with a little cotton wool, can enjoy for the price of 1s.

While my right eye is fairly long-sighted, my left eye is very short-sighted. For instance, the focal distance of my right eye for your leader type is 18 inches, and for the left eye only 8\u00bc inches. For your letter type the focal distance for the one is 16 inches, and for the other 6\u00bd inches. This is by the light of a Duplex lamp, and by focal distance, I mean the distance at which I can see distinctly. The result of this inequality in my two eyes is that the right\u2014or long-sighted one\u2014involuntarily closes when I read, and I am not aware of its being shut, except when some one who is a stranger to the peculiarity calls attention to it. During the day, however, in looking about both eyes are generally open, though when I look intently at a distant view, I find the short-sighted eye shuts occasionally. But in a general way both eyes are open, and I have two distinct images presented to my brain, one blurred and indistinct, even for faces a yard distant, and the other clearly defined, I believe, to the usual distances. How is it that my brain or mind rejects the blurred image and chooses the distinct one, so that I see everything perfectly clearly. If I get a piece of dust in the good eye, or close it, I immediately see the blurred image, and if this take place in the street, it causes a painful degree of confusion as to distances, &c., so that I am often brought to a standstill by such an occurrence. That both images really are presented to the brain I know. For instance, in travelling by train I frequently amuse myself by placing my eyes so that the short-sighted eye sees a portion of a scene through the window, without the good eye being able to see it. Then I see the blurred image only; but as the train moves the blurred is replaced by the bright one, as the good eye gets to work. The blurred image always appears at a higher level than the other, and it is the same when I shut my good eye for a moment and look at the fire with my bad one. On reopening the good one the blurred fire appears slightly above the bright one, and the latter almost instantly drives the indistinct image away\u2014like a dissolving view. Things appear, as a rule, much flatter to me than to people who enjoy binocular vision. I know this because I have a pair of spectacles so arranged as to equalise my sights. When I put them on, objects like trees put on a delightful fulness and roundness to which I am usually quite a stranger, and the effect is most charming.

Being merely an amateur in this kind of research, I shall be glad to receive any suggestions from experienced gentlemen as to important points that should be looked after.","dc.creator":["MUNRO, ROBERT"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["MUNRO, ROBERT"],"citation_author_institution":["Kilmarnock"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Ayrshire Crannog","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Ayrshire Crannog&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"019097a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

I have seen the edge of joists cut or gnawed about eight inches above the ground, where the rat would have to stand on its hind legs to do it\u2014What was that for? Again, why does our cat scratch the legs of the kitchen table?

Therefore my reply is provisional. A hint was given of Mr. Frankland's explanation by Mr. Newcomb in a phrase quoted by Mr. Halsted (American journ. of Math., I. iii. 275, paper on the bibliography of hyperspace, &c.): \u201cThe first elements of complex functions imply that a line can change direction without passing through infinity or zero.\u201d We do not require even the first elements of complex functions to tell us that we can get to the other side of a point without passing through it, provided we can go round it. But the question was not whether \u201ca line\u201d simply could be thus reversed, but whether it could be so with the geodetic perpendicular in question described in a uniform continuous manifold of two dimensions.

Therefore my reply is provisional. A hint was given of Mr. Frankland's explanation by Mr. Newcomb in a phrase quoted by Mr. Halsted (American journ. of Math., I. iii. 275, paper on the bibliography of hyperspace, &c.): \u201cThe first elements of complex functions imply that a line can change direction without passing through infinity or zero.\u201d We do not require even the first elements of complex functions to tell us that we can get to the other side of a point without passing through it, provided we can go round it. But the question was not whether \u201ca line\u201d simply could be thus reversed, but whether it could be so with the geodetic perpendicular in question described in a uniform continuous manifold of two dimensions. Mr. Frankland's explanation expressly takes account of a third dimension. It supposes the moving line to generate a sort of skew helicoid about the fixed line to which it is perpendicular. But how can even initial portions of successive generators be in the same plane, Euclidean or other? This point may seem incidental, but I think it is essential, so I omit further questions.","dc.creator":["MONRO, C.

The way in which Mr. Chambers accounts for the low pressure seems, however, rather far-fetched. It is true that on one or two of the American weather charts storm tracks are shown extending from the Mediterranean to Northern India or the Bay of Bengal, but these paths are drawn with dotted lines indicating that they are doubtful, and, considering the absence of meteorological stations in the greater part of the area between the Mediterranean and India, and the nature of the intervening country\u2014especially Afghanistan with its high mountains\u2014I should say the evidence upon the strength of which the American chartographer laid down these storm tracks, was of the slightest possible description.

The gallery is very dark, the only light entering it by the narrow entrance and crevices between the rocks. At the extreme end of the gallery is an opening to the sky large enough to put one's hand through.

At the extreme end of the gallery is an opening to the sky large enough to put one's hand through.

Possibly my experience in this connection may be of interest. I began to teach biology some ten years ago. Two years' experience satisfied me \u201cthat the power of repeating a classification of animals with all the appropriate definitions has any thing to do with genuine knowledge is one of the commonest and most mischievous delusions of both students and their examiners.\u201d For the third year I prepared a series of laboratory notes sufficient for the dissection of a few plants and animals. Since the publication of Huxley and Martin's admirable text-book of biology we have used that as a laboratory guide. Through the liberality of the School Board we are provided with eight of Beck's students' microscopes. We begin with the study of the torula; we then take in succession the following organisms:\u2014Protococcus, am\u0153ba, bacteria, mould, stone-wort, ferns, flowering plants, infusorian fresh-water polyp, clam lobster, and frog. We devote to laboratory work one hour daily for seven months. At the end of the course come morphological and physiological generalisations. Our classes number about eighty, and are divided into working sections of sixteen each. The average age of the students is sixteen years, rather more than half of them being girls.

Possibly my experience in this connection may be of interest. I began to teach biology some ten years ago. Two years' experience satisfied me \u201cthat the power of repeating a classification of animals with all the appropriate definitions has any thing to do with genuine knowledge is one of the commonest and most mischievous delusions of both students and their examiners.\u201d For the third year I prepared a series of laboratory notes sufficient for the dissection of a few plants and animals. Since the publication of Huxley and Martin's admirable text-book of biology we have used that as a laboratory guide. Through the liberality of the School Board we are provided with eight of Beck's students' microscopes. We begin with the study of the torula; we then take in succession the following organisms:\u2014Protococcus, am\u0153ba, bacteria, mould, stone-wort, ferns, flowering plants, infusorian fresh-water polyp, clam lobster, and frog. We devote to laboratory work one hour daily for seven months. At the end of the course come morphological and physiological generalisations. Our classes number about eighty, and are divided into working sections of sixteen each. The average age of the students is sixteen years, rather more than half of them being girls. I have found the students eager and enthusiastic, and a large majority of them regret the untimely end of their study of biology. To enter college a lad needs between four and five years' work in Latin, and, if a scientific student, about five weeks in botany. Most of our high schools accept this estimate of the value of a scientific training, and only do the little that is necessary for the pass examination.","dc.creator":["PECKHAM, GEO.

The light of the aurora was quite colourless.","dc.creator":["EVERSHED, SYDNEY"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["EVERSHED, SYDNEY"],"citation_author_institution":["Kenley, Surrey"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Recent Aurora","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Recent Aurora&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"026573d0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The path which I ventured to assign for it in your issue of November 30, from a digest of the printed reports, as compared with my own observations at Clevedon, proves to have been substantially correct.

It seemed to me to appear in the S.E.E. and disappear S.W. by S., but these are not the directions of those points where the trajectory and the horizon would intersect. By mentally continuing the apparent path down to the east and west horizons, points would be reached, nearly, but I think not quite, 180\u00b0 apart, the former about 20\u00b0 N. of E. and the latter nearly opposite, so that I scarcely think that it was a great circle, but it is very uncertain. Mr. Saxby states that a similar cloud was observed to cross the zenith of Brussels by M. Montigny. Now there are two accounts\u2014one by M. Zeeman of Ziericksee and the other from near Rye (Sussex)\u2014which seem to consistently apply to one and the same thing, for the latter place is W. by 20\u00b0 S. from Ziericksee, and from both places the same elevation of about 50\u00b0 was reached. These accounts, if combined with that from Brussels, indicate a height of about 70 miles; but then how does such a height agree with some of the English observations? On the supposition of the above height, the altitudes of culmination as seen from Woodbridge and Windsor would be about 29\u00b0, from Bristol 25\u00b0, and from York 10\u00b0 only, which last angle is directly at variance with the actual one. For my part, I will give up the reconciling of such contradictory evidence to those who have an aptitude for conundrums. The evidence is in favour of this being an auroral manifestation, but the spectrum of the cloud does not prove this, for as yet it is not known whether the extremely rarefied upper atmosphere may not be excited to such incandescence as will yield the so-called \u201cauroral\u201d spectrum by other means than the electric discharge, as, for instance, by the passage of a cloud of meteorites. Mr. Petrie upholds the latter hypothesis, but I think that there is a simple but weighty objection to it; for it is difficult to see how a cloud of meteoric dust of such closeness and defined form as the appearance of this cloud would imply, could travel through space for any length of time without coalescing into one granular lump, owing to the mutual gravitation of its particles. Of course this objection will have the less weight the smaller we suppose the individual particles to be. This argument will scarcely apply to the well-known meteor streams, whose individual particles are really so very far apart. If this \u201cflying arch\u201d was subject to gravity, it certainly bad more than sufficient velocity to prevent it being appropriated by our earth as a satellite, for the tangential speed necessary to a circular orbit of 4100 miles radius round our earth would only be about 4\u00be miles per second, with a period of 1\u00bd hours. All interested in this phenomenon will no doubt pay more attention to the southern sky during future auroras, in hopes of noting something more of a similar nature, and they will also look forward to seeing a full account of Prof. Lemstr\u00f6m's remarkable experiments on the nature of the aurora, which he has been conducting at Sodankyl\u00e4 with such unlooked-for results.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"27","prism.number":"697","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"434","prism.endingPage":"434","prism.copyright":"1883 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/027434b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/027434b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/027434b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/027434b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Meteoroid of November 17, 1882","citation_volume":"27","citation_issue":"697","citation_publication_date":"1883/03","citation_firstpage":"434","citation_lastpage":"434","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/027434b0","DOI":"10.1038/027434b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/027434b0","description":"THERE has already been much discussion on this subject, but I do not think that such exceptional phenomena lose any of their interest by having happened a few mouths ago; and so I write partly to correct a misapprehension on the part of Mr. Backhouse and Mr. Groneman as to the bearings of the positions of appearance and disappearance of the meteoroid as seen by myself.

F. Stanley (p. 488) requests references to where it has been considered that the sinking on the coast of Greenland is due to the weight of inland accumulation of ice. If Mr. Stanley has only so lately as the present year advocated this opinion, though doubtless the idea has arisen independently with him, he certainly has no right to consider himself the originator of it, which he seems disposed to do.

Ten months have passed since that letter was published, and a fifth student, Mr. W. Swain, has now joined the original party of four. On Sunday, June 15, these admirable workers called upon me with their recent discoveries.

Ten months have passed since that letter was published, and a fifth student, Mr. W. Swain, has now joined the original party of four.

In form it is very like a gigantic hornet; the wings and legs are of an orange colour, as is also the abdomen, which is decorated with broad black stripes. It has a strange habit of building its nest, composed of tempered mud, in keyholes. Mr. Ellery, F.R.S., the Government Astronomer, tells me that this same fly often commences to build within the tubes of their astronomical instruments. The nest is rather peculiar. A layer of mud is first laid down, and a certain number of eggs are laid. Then follows another layer of mud; on this are deposited a number of young spiders, paralysed but not killed. Another layer of mud, more eggs, then mud, then spiders again, and so on, until the nest is complete. The spiders are evidently stored up as food for the grubs, as soon as hatched, an arrangement already known to naturalists. This fly has a very fierce aspect, and its nature evidently does not belie its looks. It flies about with great liveliness, and when alighting, its long black antenn\u00e6 are kept in a state of constant motion. Its favourite food seems to be spiders, which it is in the habit of seeking for under the bark and in holes in the trunk of the Eucalyptus. It order to catch them it burrows under the loose bark, and in a few seconds generally issues forth again with some larger or smaller prey between its mandibles. The enormous bulk of some of the victims does not appear to intimidate it in the least. Even the gigantic so-called tarantula (vulgarly triantelope) is fearlessly attacked. I was one day walking through a suburban park near Melbourne, and saw one of these flies suddenly pounce down on the back of a large tarantula some five inches in breadth, measuring from the ends of the legs. The huge arachnidian succumbed at once. Resistance with an adversary in such a position was altogether out of the question, the only resource being to die, like C\u00e6sar, becomingly. I watched the fight, or rather the murder, for some minutes, and then touching the assailant with the point of my umbrella, drove it away. It only flew, however, to a short distance, and then returned, flying so viciously round that I fully expected I should be attacked. By flourishing the umbrella, however, I again drove it off, and it retired to a distance of about a hundred feet. I then left the spider, but afterwards went back, and found the mason-fly following up his victory as energetically as ever. I drove it away again, left the spot, and again returned to find the murderous work still going on. This was repeated some half a dozen times, and at last, taking out a book, I sat down on a seat resolving to see what would happen. The fly did not reappear for nearly a quarter of an hour, and I thought it had altogether departed. A small ditch ran beside the pathway, and, turning my eyes in that direction, I noticed the mason-fly peeping through some blades of grass growing on the edge. It was evidently waiting for me to leave the spot in order to secure the full advantages of its victory.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"30","prism.number":"775","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"436","prism.endingPage":"436","prism.copyright":"1884 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/030436a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/030436a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/030436a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/030436a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Singular Instance of Instinct","citation_volume":"30","citation_issue":"775","citation_publication_date":"1884/09","citation_firstpage":"436","citation_lastpage":"436","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/030436a0","DOI":"10.1038/030436a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/030436a0","description":"AMONG the insects very common to Victoria is one popularly known as the mason-fly.

I do not know if it is a common production, but the special interest attached to it is that it would seem to suggest how \u201cspongy\u201d quartz has arisen, of which I have a specimen consisting of thin and nearly parallel plates; as well as the well-known form of thin crystalline plates in which calcite may occur. It is just this form of calcite which gives rise to \u201chacked\u201d quartz, when silica has coagulated or crystallised over a mass of such thin crystals, and then these latter have been subsequently dissolved out.","dc.creator":["HENSLOW, GEORGE"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["HENSLOW, GEORGE"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Forms of Ice","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Forms of Ice&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"033559b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The lectures were illustrated by some optical experiments with electric light and some lantern-slides relative to Newton's biography.","dc.creator":["STOLETOW, A."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["STOLETOW, A."],"citation_author_institution":["University of Moscow,"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Newton's \u201cPrincipia\u201d","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Newton&#39;s &#8220;Principia&#8221;&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"037294b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This is the Tamaron of the natives, a wild species of the family Bovid\u00e6, allied to the Anoa of Celebes, which Prof. Steere proposes to call Anoa mindorensis. Its general colour is black, the hairs being short and rather fine. A greyish white stripe runs from near the inner corner of the eye towards the base of the horn. There is also a greyish white spot above the hoof on all the feet, and a greyish white patch on the inside of the lower fore-leg. The height of the male at the shoulder is about 3 feet 6 inches, the length from the nose to the base of the tail about 6 feet 8 inches. The horns are about 14 inches long. Prof. Steere obtained two males and one female of this animal, of which his full description will be read at the first meeting of the next session of the Zoological Society.

Seeing, however, plenty of small, equal spherical pebbles near the place, he cast them one by one into the pitcher, and thus by degrees raised the water up to the very brim and satisfied his thirst. Prove that the volume of water must have been to that of the pitcher in a ratio not less than 3\u221a2 \u2212 \u03c0 3\u221a2.\u201d References are supplied in the article by the Rev. Dr. Luard to Pliny's \u201cNatural History,\u201d book x. chapter 43, \u201cDe Corvorum Intelligenti\u00e2\u201d; Plutarch, \u201cDe Solerti\u00e2 Animalium; and \u00c6lian, \u201cDe Natur\u00e2 Animalium.\u201d Consult also Tait's \u201cProperties of Matter.\u201d","dc.creator":["GREENHILL, A.

We occasionally hear of the organization of science, but the very ABC is at present neglected, or carried out in a spasmodic and disjointed manner. Let us take for example geology. We have several attempts at a catalogue and review of its yearly literature, of which I give the following examples. First comes the \u201cGeological Record,\u201d a publication very well in its way, but making its appearance at irregular intervals, and often much behind time. We have in Prof. Blake's Annual the attempt of a single individual to cope with a mass of literature that it is impossible for him to read, and treating of questions that no single person is or can be qualified to deal justly with. The very obvious result of this is careless reviewing, and general dissatisfaction of most authors whose papers are submitted to the abstracting process. I hope Prof. Blake will not take these words as a disparaging appreciation of his attempt, which I think does him much credit as a single-handed worker, but it will not satisfy the geologists in general. Next we have the \u201cAnnuaire G\u00e9ologique Universel,\u201d for which great credit is due to Drs. Carey and Agincourt. Here we have the geological literature of each country treated separately, followed by a subject literature. Each article is compiled by a specialist in his own branch, and one who is able to form a just opinion of the work and appreciate the salient points of it. Altogether the organization of the \u201cAnnuaire\u201d is on the right lines, but I understand it is not a financial success, and I have very grave doubts if it will continue, because the supporters of one publication cannot be the supporters of several. The motto \u201cL'union fait la force\u201d is as true in this case as in any other. Then again there is not that official character about it that there would be with international co-operation, supported by governments, scientific societies, &c. As two years' collaborator for the subjects of seismology and vulcanology I can give some of my experiences. In the first place it means a very big slice of time to read (for without this the thing had better be left alone) and review the annual literature of such subjects; for this there is no recompense whatever, but as I shall show actual money out of pocket. It is impossible for the reviewer, unless residing in such towns as London, Paris, or Berlin, to see all the literature of his subject. He, therefore, has to send out circulars, the expenses and postage of which, without counting labour of addressing, I found to come to about 2l. annually. A considerable proportion of these circulars are not even answered by those who have published papers on the subject during the year, and I am sorry to say that in one or two cases I have had a reply insinuating that I had been \u201ccadging\u201d for a copy of the author's paper or book. After the review is published come protests from authors (not many in my case, fortunately,) whom, out of common courtesy, time and money must be spent in answering. Finally, with every care such a work is far from complete. I would, therefore, hazard the following propositions:\u2014A preliminary committee to be formed as soon as possible to study the question of international records of scientific literature. That such committee should determine the language of such records, the methods of organization of each separate subject committee, the means and resources of such, and invite the co-operation of other nations.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"46","prism.number":"1193","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"441","prism.endingPage":"442","prism.copyright":"1892 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/046441c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/046441c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/046441c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/046441c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"International, Geological, and other Records","citation_volume":"46","citation_issue":"1193","citation_publication_date":"1892/09","citation_firstpage":"441","citation_lastpage":"442","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/046441c0","DOI":"10.1038/046441c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/046441c0","description":"My friend Mr. Minchin's letter has opened a question that I have been ruminating for a very long time.

On July 29 last year I visited Cambridge for the purpose of comparing the bones from the Chatham Islands I had brought with me with the real Aphanapteryx remains in the Museum there. It turned out that Dr. Gadow, who was abroad, had laid them aside where Prof. Newton could not place his hand upon them, and I was, therefore, unable to see them. A week or two later, when in Edinburgh at the British Association Meeting, in a note intimating the return of Dr. Gadow, and kindly arranging for my examination of the bones, Prof. Newton adds, \u201cI believe you will want a new generic name for what you have called Aphanapteryx\u201d and suggests the name Diaphorapteryx instead. I was unavoidably long prevented from revisiting the Cambridge Museum, and so in describing as Diaphorapteryx the Chatham Island bones, at a meeting of the British Ornithologists' Club in December, 1892, I accepted the suggestion of Prof. Newton, who alone had till then seen the remains from both localities. On February 23, prior to reading my paper at the Royal Geographical Society, I again visited Cambridge, and in the most kind manner received every facility and assistance both from the Professor and from Dr. Gadow in comparing the specimens. On this occasion I was unable to recognise any sufficient characters, by which, in my estimation, to separate generically the bones from the Chatham Islands from those from Mauritius. This decision I stated at the meeting of the R.G.S. on March 13 last, and more recently in a communication to the Brit. Ornith. Club, which will appear in its forthcoming Bulletin. If I mistake not, however, Prof. Newton agreed with me that the Chatham Island form was nearer to Aphanapteryx than the latter was to Erythromachus of Rodriguez. Some of these remains from Mauritius have been figured by Prof. Milne-Edwards in his \u201cOiseaux Fossiles de France,\u201d and the remainder are fully discussed and illustrated by Dr. Gadow in a shortly-to-be-issued fasciculus of the Trans.Z.S. of London, while those from the Chatham Islands will appear shortly, I hope, in one or other of the scientific journals or Proceedings. After a careful study of all the material I have no hesitation, however, in stating meantime\u2014as those who care will then have an opportunity of judging\u2014that the bones from both regions are generically the same. I maintain also, that even if some osteologists should be disposed (from the somewhat larger size of the Chatham Island bones, though among them I found a number scarcely to be separated on even that ground) to make a generic distinction between them, the question would not only not fall, but I really cannot see that the argument based on their discovery in the New Zealand region would be in the least invalidated, as the forms are unquestionably so very nearly related. The importance of the distribution of the blue Water-hens, and the relationship between the Huias of New Zealand and the Frigelupus of Reunion\u2014long ago pointed out by Mr. Wallace\u2014and many other facts as far as birds are concerned recently urged by Dr. Sharpe at the Royal Institution, appears now to a fuller extent by the discovery of those unexpected forms in the Chatham Islands.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"48","prism.number":"1232","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"126","prism.endingPage":"126","prism.copyright":"1893 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/048126a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/048126a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/048126a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/048126a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Mr. H.

On July 29 last year I visited Cambridge for the purpose of comparing the bones from the Chatham Islands I had brought with me with the real Aphanapteryx remains in the Museum there. It turned out that Dr. Gadow, who was abroad, had laid them aside where Prof. Newton could not place his hand upon them, and I was, therefore, unable to see them. A week or two later, when in Edinburgh at the British Association Meeting, in a note intimating the return of Dr. Gadow, and kindly arranging for my examination of the bones, Prof. Newton adds, \u201cI believe you will want a new generic name for what you have called Aphanapteryx\u201d and suggests the name Diaphorapteryx instead.

Further, it is seldom that the waves break at all, or even \u201ccurl over\u201d on the shores of Morecambe Bay, where it is flat; but the water simply overflows the banks of the channel of the river Kent, whose course is followed by the tidal wave. There are limestone quarries at or near Arnside, Silverdale, Warton, Carnforth and Berwick.","dc.creator":["FIRTH, O."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["FIRTH, O."],"citation_author_institution":["Hawthorn House, Baildon, Yorks"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Remarkable Sounds","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Remarkable Sounds&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"053295c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

I did not see the train in the form of sparks, but as light. Before it died away, both nucleus and train became bright crimson and an equally brilliant blue. There was no explosion heard by me.","dc.creator":["SMITH, WORTHINGTON G."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["SMITH, WORTHINGTON G."],"citation_author_institution":["Dunstable"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Bright Meteor of April 12","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Bright Meteor of April 12&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"054172c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

But it is quite possible that Sir George Stokes in 1852 saw as far as we can see to-day.","dc.creator":["LODGE, OLIVER J.","DAVIES, BENJAMIN"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["LODGE, OLIVER J.","DAVIES, BENJAMIN"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Extension of the Visible Spectrum","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Extension of the Visible Spectrum&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"055225c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

They have often been met before. As to the special case under discussion, he feels that his knowledge of the distribution of the two species is exhaustive enough to give him safe warrant for the assertion that they are invariably separated by a height of 6000 feet.

Great care has been employed with the pick as each succeeding layer of clay was reached, and more than one false alarm has been raised. Last week a specimen less complete, but still remarkable, was unearthed in the cement works belonging to Messrs. Kay and Co. It lies 50 feet below the surface. The head is tolerably perfect, showing the teeth and one of the eyes. The ribs and paddles are much dislocated, and the lower part of the tail is wanting.

Great care has been employed with the pick as each succeeding layer of clay was reached, and more than one false alarm has been raised. Last week a specimen less complete, but still remarkable, was unearthed in the cement works belonging to Messrs. Kay and Co. It lies 50 feet below the surface. The head is tolerably perfect, showing the teeth and one of the eyes. The ribs and paddles are much dislocated, and the lower part of the tail is wanting. The length of the head is 2 feet 8 inches, of the whole fragment 7 feet.

Its object was to solve a problem of the following kind:\u201440 per cent, of the members at a meeting vote that a proposed grant should be less than 100l., 80 per cent, vote that it should exceed 500l. What is the Median Estimate, supposing the normal law of frequency to hold good? That is to say, What is the sum that one-half of the members would think too little, and the other half too much, and which therefore presents the best compromise between many discordant opinions? I showed that the calculation was exceedingly simple if certain tabular values are used that will be spoken of later. But, on after reflection, it seems to me that further simplification is both desirable and feasible. The problem is representative of a large class of much importance to anthropologists in the field, few of whom appear to be quick at arithmetic or acquainted even with the elements of algebra. They often desire to ascertain the physical characteristics of races who are too timorous or suspicious to be measured individually, but who could easily be dealt with by my method. Suppose it to be a question of strength, as measured by lifting power, and that it has been ascertained that a per cent. of them fail to lift a certain bag A of known weight, and that b per cent. of them fail to lift another heavier bag B. From these two data, the median strength can be determined by the simple method spoken of above, and not only it but also the distribution of strengths among the people. Having indicated the utility and importance of the general problem, I will proceed to work out the particular case of the voters by the now further simplified method. In Fig. 2 let the base line G represent 100l. and let each successive horizontal line above it represent an increment of 100l. A dot A is placed on G, at the division 40\u00b0, and another dot B is placed on the ordinate at the division 80\u00b0 at the level of the fourth line above G.

Its object was to solve a problem of the following kind:\u201440 per cent, of the members at a meeting vote that a proposed grant should be less than 100l., 80 per cent, vote that it should exceed 500l. What is the Median Estimate, supposing the normal law of frequency to hold good? That is to say, What is the sum that one-half of the members would think too little, and the other half too much, and which therefore presents the best compromise between many discordant opinions? I showed that the calculation was exceedingly simple if certain tabular values are used that will be spoken of later. But, on after reflection, it seems to me that further simplification is both desirable and feasible. The problem is representative of a large class of much importance to anthropologists in the field, few of whom appear to be quick at arithmetic or acquainted even with the elements of algebra. They often desire to ascertain the physical characteristics of races who are too timorous or suspicious to be measured individually, but who could easily be dealt with by my method. Suppose it to be a question of strength, as measured by lifting power, and that it has been ascertained that a per cent. of them fail to lift a certain bag A of known weight, and that b per cent. of them fail to lift another heavier bag B. From these two data, the median strength can be determined by the simple method spoken of above, and not only it but also the distribution of strengths among the people. Having indicated the utility and importance of the general problem, I will proceed to work out the particular case of the voters by the now further simplified method. In Fig. 2 let the base line G represent 100l. and let each successive horizontal line above it represent an increment of 100l. A dot A is placed on G, at the division 40\u00b0, and another dot B is placed on the ordinate at the division 80\u00b0 at the level of the fourth line above G. Therefore A and B are plotted at their respective places. Join the two dots with a straight line. The place where this line cuts the ordinate at 50\u00b0, shows the Median value. The principle on which this exceedingly simple process rests must be explained by beginning with Fig. 1, where an ordinary curve of distribution is drawn about the axis H, with a quartile equal to 1. The centiles from the axis to the curve are given in the following small table (see my \u201cNatural Inheritance,\u201d Macmillan, 1889) which is reproduced here for convenience.","dc.creator":["GALTON, FRANCIS"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["GALTON, FRANCIS"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"A Geometric Determination of the Median Value...","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;A Geometric Determination of the Median Value of a System of Normal Variants, from two of its...","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"061152b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The cylinders used were 25 cm. in diameter, and were made of zinc, tin and lead; the current in the lead cylinder was about twice that in the zinc, and about 50 per cent, greater than in the tin.

The cylinders used were 25 cm. in diameter, and were made of zinc, tin and lead; the current in the lead cylinder was about twice that in the zinc, and about 50 per cent, greater than in the tin. The authors found that the current in the cylinders was considerably reduced by immersing the cylinders in a large cistern full of water, indicating that part of the ionisation is due to very penetrating radiation which gets through the sides of the cylinder.

There is still another old standing difficulty which it appears to be able to solve, viz. the permanent maintenance of the electrical field in the lower regions of the earth's atmosphere. If we take for granted that the sun continually emits Becquerel rays consisting of positive and negative electrons, one would expect the following to be the consequence. Some of the electrons which reach the earth's atmosphere will be absorbed\u2014probably mainly by the water vapour and dust in the lower atmosphere\u2014but according to Rutherford's experiments more positive than negative; thus we may expect a greater number of negative electrons to reach the surface, a corresponding number of positive electrons being held back by the air. We at once see a cause for the positive charge of the air and the corresponding negative charge on the surface. If there were no \u201cdissipation\u201d the result would be a continual charging up of the atmosphere or an ever increasing potential gradient above the earth's surface; but there is dissipation, and it counterbalances the tendency of the electrical field to increase. If we had a constant dissipation the result would be a maximum potential gradient in the daytime and a minimum in the night, for we must assume that more electrons reach the atmosphere in the day than in the night. But we know from Elster and Geitel's measurements that the dissipation reaches a maximum at midday; this will tend to reduce the maximum of potential gradient which would otherwise be reached about that time. This consideration agrees entirely with the fact, for Exner has described the daily variation of the potential gradient as \u201ca simple daily period, distorted by a midday depression.\u201d With the fairly constant daily period of the entrance of electrons into the atmosphere, the main determining factor of the potential gradient will be the dissipation; thus we find a maximum potential gradient in the winter with a corresponding minimum dissipation. The relation between potential gradient and dissipation has been thoroughly investigated by Elster and Geitel, and they have found experimentally that that which tends to reduce the dissipation tends to increase the potential gradient, which is just what one would expect from the theory.

It may be that Dr. Shaw-Mackenzie's advocacy of the trypsin treatment of cancer was based on a misconception, but that he did independently evolve it seems clear to us, and this is all that was suggested in the article. His line of treatment is indicated in a letter to the British Medical Journal, May 27, 1905, p. 1183, and again in the same journal, January 27, 1906, p. 240; in the latter not only trypsin, but pancreatin and secretin are suggested. As regards the term \u201ctrypsin treatment,\u201d Dr. Beard, in an article in the British Medical Journal (January 20, 1906, p. 140), uses the phrases, \u201cthe length of time and number of injections of trypsin necessary to destroy the tumour,\u201d \u201ctrypsin is the substance which will destroy the cancer cell (Beard and Shaw-Mackenzie),\u201d &c., and he moreover states, \u201cthe preparation of trypsin employed (Fairchild Bros. and Foster's). was that originally dispensed to Dr. Shaw-Mackenzie's prescription by Mr. F. W. Gamble,\u201d thus acknowledging Dr. Shaw-Mackenzie's work, and actually making use of the latter's preparation of trypsin! Accepting the details of the case of cancer of the tongue cured by pancreatic extract as correct, it is a remarkable one, but not unique. The writer knows a case of mammary cancer, diagnosed as such 41/2;years ago by four doctors, and on which a London surgeon refused to operate, which after treatment with X-rays has atrophied, and the patient is well and in good health today, surely as remarkable a case! Lastly, with regard to the alleged cures of cancer obtained by Prof. Morton in America (to which reference was made in the article), these are summarised in the British Medical Journal, December 22, 1906, p. 1835. About thirty cases were treated, and the results claimed are cure in two cases, remarkable atrophy of the tumour in one, and arrest of disease in many. In one case the \u201ccure\u201d has lasted four months, in the other one month! It is absurd yet to speak of such cases as \u201ccured\u201d careful surgeons allow a three years' limit!

It may be that Dr. Shaw-Mackenzie's advocacy of the trypsin treatment of cancer was based on a misconception, but that he did independently evolve it seems clear to us, and this is all that was suggested in the article. His line of treatment is indicated in a letter to the British Medical Journal, May 27, 1905, p. 1183, and again in the same journal, January 27, 1906, p. 240; in the latter not only trypsin, but pancreatin and secretin are suggested. As regards the term \u201ctrypsin treatment,\u201d Dr. Beard, in an article in the British Medical Journal (January 20, 1906, p. 140), uses the phrases, \u201cthe length of time and number of injections of trypsin necessary to destroy the tumour,\u201d \u201ctrypsin is the substance which will destroy the cancer cell (Beard and Shaw-Mackenzie),\u201d &c., and he moreover states, \u201cthe preparation of trypsin employed (Fairchild Bros. and Foster's). was that originally dispensed to Dr. Shaw-Mackenzie's prescription by Mr. F. W. Gamble,\u201d thus acknowledging Dr. Shaw-Mackenzie's work, and actually making use of the latter's preparation of trypsin! Accepting the details of the case of cancer of the tongue cured by pancreatic extract as correct, it is a remarkable one, but not unique. The writer knows a case of mammary cancer, diagnosed as such 41/2;years ago by four doctors, and on which a London surgeon refused to operate, which after treatment with X-rays has atrophied, and the patient is well and in good health today, surely as remarkable a case! Lastly, with regard to the alleged cures of cancer obtained by Prof. Morton in America (to which reference was made in the article), these are summarised in the British Medical Journal, December 22, 1906, p. 1835. About thirty cases were treated, and the results claimed are cure in two cases, remarkable atrophy of the tumour in one, and arrest of disease in many. In one case the \u201ccure\u201d has lasted four months, in the other one month! It is absurd yet to speak of such cases as \u201ccured\u201d careful surgeons allow a three years' limit! To claim that \u201cthe cure\u201d for cancer has been found has at present nothing to substantiate it, and in our opinion Dr. Shaw-Mackenzie's position is far more scientific than Dr. Beard's. We believe that the pancreatic enzymes must be injected into the neighbourhood of the growth or used locally; how, then, could the secondary growths in internal organs, &c., be attacked? Until this can be done, no \u201ccure\u201d for cancer will have been obtained.","dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Treatment of Cancer","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Treatment of Cancer&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"075270a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The small margin of only 4\u00b0 does not seem to be quite enough entirely to prevent anchor ice; still we have reason to be thankful for these few degrees.","dc.creator":["AITKEN, JOHN"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["AITKEN, JOHN"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Maximum Density of Water","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Maximum Density of Water&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"091581c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

He selects four characteristic types accompanying shifts of wind, and finds that the verification did not exceed 58 per cent. The temperature forecasts were even less accurate, being correct only 161 times; and while the given percentage is 52, a truer value, including doubtful and \u201cno\u201d forecasts, would be 44.

On the other hand, Sir Herbert throws more responsibility on me than I ever undertook, and he sweeps aside all the qualifying and questioning words with which I was careful to safeguard my letter: not that I wanted to hedge or hide behind these, but simply that my object was to suggest an inquiry, not to lay down the law.

Organic\u2013inorganic hybrid versions have also been produced, by trapping metal ions or metal clusters within the voids of the dendrimers7,8,9,10,11,12,13. The unusual, tree-like topology endows these nanometre-sized macromolecules with a gradient in branch density from the interior to the exterior, which can give rise to an energy gradient that directs the transfer of charge and energy from the dendrimer periphery to its core4,5,6. Here we show that tin ions, Sn2+, complex to the imine groups of a spherical polyphenylazomethine dendrimer in a stepwise fashion.

Organic\u2013inorganic hybrid versions have also been produced, by trapping metal ions or metal clusters within the voids of the dendrimers7,8,9,10,11,12,13. The unusual, tree-like topology endows these nanometre-sized macromolecules with a gradient in branch density from the interior to the exterior, which can give rise to an energy gradient that directs the transfer of charge and energy from the dendrimer periphery to its core4,5,6. Here we show that tin ions, Sn2+, complex to the imine groups of a spherical polyphenylazomethine dendrimer in a stepwise fashion. This behaviour reflects a gradient in the electron density associated with the imine groups, with complexation in a more peripheral generation proceeding only after complexation in generations closer to the core has been completed. By attaching an electron-withdrawing group to the dendrimer core, we are able to change the complexation pattern, so that the core imines are complexed last.

The nature of the progenitors responsible for the bursts remains, however, elusive. The favoured models range from the merger of two neutron stars in a binary system3,4,5 to the collapse of a massive star6,7,8.

The nature of the progenitors responsible for the bursts remains, however, elusive. The favoured models range from the merger of two neutron stars in a binary system3,4,5 to the collapse of a massive star6,7,8.

These results may help distinguish between the different dynamic states proposed for outer-core flow2,3,4,5 and provide a test for recent numerical models of the geodynamo6,7,8,9.","dc.creator":["Zatman, Stephen","Bloxham, Jeremy"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Geophys.

The unifying classification schemes for AGN further propose that differences in their appearance can be attributed to the opacity of the accreting material, which may obstruct our view of the central region of some systems. The popular model for the obscuring medium is a parsec-scale disk of dense molecular gas4, although evidence for such disks has been mostly indirect, as their angular size is much smaller than the resolution of conventional telescopes.

The unifying classification schemes for AGN further propose that differences in their appearance can be attributed to the opacity of the accreting material, which may obstruct our view of the central region of some systems. The popular model for the obscuring medium is a parsec-scale disk of dense molecular gas4, although evidence for such disks has been mostly indirect, as their angular size is much smaller than the resolution of conventional telescopes. Here we report direct images of a parsec-scale disk of ionized gas within the nucleus of NGC1068, the archetype of obscured AGN.

Such uplift occurs rapidly because substantial volumes of basaltic melt are added to the crust over geologically short periods of time (1\u201310 Myr)2, and can lead to large amounts of clastic sediment being shed into surrounding basins3.

Such uplift occurs rapidly because substantial volumes of basaltic melt are added to the crust over geologically short periods of time (1\u201310 Myr)2, and can lead to large amounts of clastic sediment being shed into surrounding basins3. An intensively studied example of this process occurred in the North Sea basin during the Palaeogene period, where discrete pulses of deposition were triggered when sands were remobilized downslope from the shelf by turbidity currents and debris flows as a result of episodic changes of relative sea level3.

The process occurs only at the temperature of the host's habitat (75\u201390 \u00b0C) and it does not require the presence of the host cell, an exogenous energy source or any cofactors. This host-independent morphological development may be a strategy for viral survival in an environment that is unusually harsh and has limited host availability.","dc.creator":["H\u00e4ring, Monika","Vestergaard, Gisle","Rachel, Reinhard","Chen, Lanming","Garrett, Roger A.","Prangishvili, David"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_title=Seventh Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses; citation_publication_date=2000; citation_id=CR1; citation_author=MHV van Regenmortel","citation_journal_title=Science; citation_author=A Lupas, M Van Dyke, J Stock; citation_volume=252; citation_publication_date=1991; citation_pages=1162-1164; citation_doi=10.1126/science.252.5009.1162; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=BioEssays; citation_author=SV Strelkov, H Herrmann, U Aebi; citation_volume=25; citation_publication_date=2003; citation_pages=243-251; citation_doi=10.1002/bies.10246; citation_id=CR3","citation_journal_title=Cell; citation_author=N Ausmess, JR Kuhn, C Jacobs-Wagner; citation_volume=115; citation_publication_date=2003; citation_pages=705-713; citation_doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00935-8; citation_id=CR4","citation_journal_title=Curr.

The IP3R is known to reside in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as well as within ER\u2013mitochondrial contact sites, and IP3R blockade triggered the autophagy of both ER and mitochondria, as exactly observed in starvation-induced autophagy.

Autophagy triggered by starvation or IP3R blockade was inhibited by Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL specifically targeted to ER but not Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL proteins targeted to mitochondria. In contrast, ER stress-induced autophagy was not inhibited by Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Autophagy promoted by IP3R inhibition could not be attributed to a modulation of steady-state Ca2+ levels in the ER or in the cytosol, yet involved the obligate contribution of Beclin-1, autophagy-related gene (Atg)5, Atg10, Atg12 and hVps34.

Thus, the substrate recognition mechanism of eukaryotic CCT may differ from that of prokaryotic GroEL.","dc.creator":["Llorca, Oscar","McCormack, Elizabeth A.","Hynes, Gillian","Grantham, Julie","Cordell, Jacqueline","Carrascosa, Jos\u00e9 L.","Willison, Keith R.","Fernandez, Jos\u00e9 J.","Valpuesta, Jos\u00e9 M."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Cell; citation_title=The hsp70 and hsp60 chaperone machines.; citation_author=B Bukau, AL Horwich; citation_volume=92; citation_publication_date=1998; citation_pages=351-366; citation_doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80928-9; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Eur.

Despite this diversity, most terrestrial carnivores can be classified as either feeding on invertebrates and small vertebrates or on large vertebrates. Small carnivores feed predominantly on invertebrates probably because they are a superabundant resource (sometimes 90% of animal biomass1,2,3); however, intake rates of invertebrate feeders are low, about one tenth of those of vertebrate feeders4,5. Although small carnivores can subsist on this diet because of low absolute energy requirements, invertebrate feeding appears to be unsustainable for larger carnivores. Here we show, by reviewing the most common live prey in carnivore diets, that there is a striking transition from feeding on small prey (less than half of predator mass) to large prey (near predator mass), occurring at predator masses of 21.5\u201325\u2009kg. We test the hypothesis that this dichotomy is the consequence of mass-related energetic requirements and we determine the predicted maximum mass that an invertebrate diet can sustain. Using a simple energetic model and known invertebrate intake rates, we predict a maximum sustainable mass of 21.5\u2009kg, which matches the point where predators shift from small to large prey.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"402","prism.number":"6759","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"286","prism.endingPage":"288","prism.copyright":"1999 Macmillan Magazines Ltd.","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/46266","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/46266","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/46266.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/46266","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Energetic constraints on the diet of terrestrial carnivores","citation_volume":"402","citation_issue":"6759","citation_publication_date":"1999/11","citation_firstpage":"286","citation_lastpage":"288","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/46266","DOI":"10.1038/46266","citation_doi":"10.1038/46266","description":"Species in the mammalian order Carnivora exhibit a huge diversity of life histories with body sizes spanning more than three orders of magnitude.

To date, however, only a small number of devices exist that can operate up to this frequency. In this study, we demonstrate that this frequency range can be addressed by nanophotonic, silicon-based modulators. We exploit the ultrafast Pockels effect by using the silicon\u2013organic hybrid (SOH) platform, which combines highly nonlinear organic molecules with silicon waveguides. Until now, the bandwidth of these devices was limited by the losses of the radiofrequency (RF) signal and the RC (resistor-capacitor) time constant of the silicon structure. The RF losses are overcome by using a device as short as 500\u2005\u00b5m, and the RC time constant is decreased by using a highly conductive electron accumulation layer and an improved gate insulator. Using this method, we demonstrate for the first time an integrated silicon modulator with a 3dB bandwidth at an operating frequency beyond 100\u2005GHz. Our results clearly indicate that the RC time constant is not a fundamental speed limitation of SOH devices at these frequencies. Our device has a voltage\u2013length product of only V\u03c0L=11\u2005V mm, which compares favorably with the best silicon-photonic modulators available today. Using cladding materials with stronger nonlinearities, the voltage\u2013length product is expected to improve by more than an order of magnitude. Researchers have developed an integrated silicon\u2013organic device capable of modulating light at frequencies of up to 100\u00a0GHz. The ultrafast modulator, fabricated by Luca Alloatti and co-workers, relies on the electro-optic Pockels effect that occurs in a polymer cladding covering a silicon slot waveguide.

To date, however, only a small number of devices exist that can operate up to this frequency. In this study, we demonstrate that this frequency range can be addressed by nanophotonic, silicon-based modulators. We exploit the ultrafast Pockels effect by using the silicon\u2013organic hybrid (SOH) platform, which combines highly nonlinear organic molecules with silicon waveguides. Until now, the bandwidth of these devices was limited by the losses of the radiofrequency (RF) signal and the RC (resistor-capacitor) time constant of the silicon structure. The RF losses are overcome by using a device as short as 500\u2005\u00b5m, and the RC time constant is decreased by using a highly conductive electron accumulation layer and an improved gate insulator. Using this method, we demonstrate for the first time an integrated silicon modulator with a 3dB bandwidth at an operating frequency beyond 100\u2005GHz. Our results clearly indicate that the RC time constant is not a fundamental speed limitation of SOH devices at these frequencies. Our device has a voltage\u2013length product of only V\u03c0L=11\u2005V mm, which compares favorably with the best silicon-photonic modulators available today. Using cladding materials with stronger nonlinearities, the voltage\u2013length product is expected to improve by more than an order of magnitude. Researchers have developed an integrated silicon\u2013organic device capable of modulating light at frequencies of up to 100\u00a0GHz. The ultrafast modulator, fabricated by Luca Alloatti and co-workers, relies on the electro-optic Pockels effect that occurs in a polymer cladding covering a silicon slot waveguide. Application of an electric field to the polymer causes its refractive index to change, which in turn modifies the phase of light passing through it. The 500-\u00b5m-long device has a half-wave voltage of 22\u00a0V, meaning that this voltage is required in order to achieve a \u03c0 phase shift for the output light. However, the researchers are confident that using a cladding material with a stronger nonlinearity could improve this figure of merit by a factor of ten.","dc.creator":["Alloatti, Luca","Palmer, Robert","Diebold, Sebastian","Pahl, Kai Philipp","Chen, Baoquan","Dinu, Raluca","Fournier, Maryse","Fedeli, Jean-Marc","Zwick, Thomas","Freude, Wolfgang","Koos, Christian","Leuthold, Juerg"],"dc.subject":["Nanophotonics and plasmonics","Optoelectronic devices and components","Silicon photonics"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=J Mater Chem;

Hence, lattice motion is negligible within the femtosecond pulse duration, whereas femtosecond photon-electron interactions dominate the entire fabrication process. Therefore, femtosecond laser fabrication must be improved by controlling localized transient electron dynamics, which poses a challenge for measuring and controlling at the electron level during fabrication processes. Pump-probe spectroscopy presents a viable solution, which can be used to observe electron dynamics during a chemical reaction. In fact, femtosecond pulse durations are shorter than many physical/chemical characteristic times, which permits manipulating, adjusting, or interfering with electron dynamics. Hence, we proposed to control localized transient electron dynamics by temporally or spatially shaping femtosecond pulses, and further to modify localized transient materials properties, and then to adjust material phase change, and eventually to implement a novel fabrication method. This review covers our progresses over the past decade regarding electrons dynamics control (EDC) by shaping femtosecond laser pulses in micro/nanomanufacturing: (1) Theoretical models were developed to prove EDC feasibility and reveal its mechanisms; (2) on the basis of the theoretical predictions, many experiments are conducted to validate our EDC-based femtosecond laser fabrication method. Seven examples are reported, which proves that the proposed method can significantly improve fabrication precision, quality, throughput and repeatability and effectively control micro/nanoscale structures; (3) a multiscale measurement system was proposed and developed to study the fundamentals of EDC from the femtosecond scale to the nanosecond scale and to the millisecond scale; and (4) As an example of practical applications, our method was employed to fabricate some key structures in one of the 16 Chinese National S&T Major Projects, for which electron dynamics were measured using our multiscale measurement system.

In fiber-optic communications, the employed linearly polarized modes and phase vortex modes carrying orbital angular momentum can be synthesized by fiber vector eigenmodes. To improve the transmission capacity and miniaturize the communication system, straightforward fiber vector eigenmode multiplexing and generation of fiber-eigenmode-like polarization vortices (vector vortex modes) using photonic integrated devices are of substantial interest. Here, we propose and demonstrate direct fiber vector eigenmode multiplexing transmission seeded by integrated optical vortex emitters.
