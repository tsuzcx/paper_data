M., saw a remarkable pale luminous appearance some 25\u00b0 above the horizon and almost due east. At this point there were two arcs of faint white lines, one above the other, both radiating outwards with a number of short points. The breadth of the upper arc (which was rather the widest) might be from twelve to twenty times the apparent diameter of the moon. It was of course broad daylight at the time, and the sky was perfectly clear and cloudless for a long distance round these patches of light. They were visible for at least ten minutes, brighter and fainter alternately, and were seen by a friend as well as myself. I was unfortunately called away, and prevented from watching them while the sky became darker. After dark (at 5.30) they had disappeared, but the dark irregular circle mentioned by Mr. Grove, from which the streamers radiated, was extremely conspicuous. It did not strike me at the time that the appearance at 4.30 was likely to have any special interest.

The spire of St. Walburge's Church, which is, perhaps, the highest point in the town, was struck by lightning, some curious phenomena resulting. The lightning conductor, a rope composed of forty-two copper wires in six strands, was ruptured at about sixty feet from the ground. The wires were untwisted and spread out, the ends fused, and some of them turned up like hooks. The discharge passed obliquely through the tower wall for a distance of about three yards to a gas-pipe inside. In its passage it wrenched a piece of stone weighing 66lb. from an immense block, casting it to a distance of a hundred feet, besides literally tearing off other large masses. Before reaching the gas-pipe it projected some bricks against the opposite interior wall, shattering them to pieces. The gaspipe was severed and the lower portion curled completely round. Thence it passed to the gas-meter and dislocated many pipes beyond. The effect upon one leaden pipe was singular, holes were fused into it, in some cases right through, the molten metal being scattered about. Another discharge passed down a conductor at the west end of the church.

The spire of St. Walburge's Church, which is, perhaps, the highest point in the town, was struck by lightning, some curious phenomena resulting. The lightning conductor, a rope composed of forty-two copper wires in six strands, was ruptured at about sixty feet from the ground. The wires were untwisted and spread out, the ends fused, and some of them turned up like hooks. The discharge passed obliquely through the tower wall for a distance of about three yards to a gas-pipe inside. In its passage it wrenched a piece of stone weighing 66lb. from an immense block, casting it to a distance of a hundred feet, besides literally tearing off other large masses. Before reaching the gas-pipe it projected some bricks against the opposite interior wall, shattering them to pieces. The gaspipe was severed and the lower portion curled completely round. Thence it passed to the gas-meter and dislocated many pipes beyond. The effect upon one leaden pipe was singular, holes were fused into it, in some cases right through, the molten metal being scattered about. Another discharge passed down a conductor at the west end of the church. The conductor itself was not ruptured, but a gas-pipe close to it was broken and a piece about a yard long was projected to a distance of forty feet, the gas meanwhile having ignited. Within the church, too, where there happened to be a leakage, the gas also ignited. It was further observed next morning that round about the church hundreds upon hundreds of worms were dead or dying.","dc.creator":["WILLIAMS, STEPHEN"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["WILLIAMS, STEPHEN"],"citation_author_institution":["Stonyhurst College,"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Thunderstorm at Preston","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Thunderstorm at Preston&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"003510a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It somewhat resembled that by which Dr. Carpenter illustrated lately at the Royal Institution his views respecting the influences of evaporation and polar cold; but as I wished specially to show how the westwardly equatorial current came about, the experiment was somewhat more complex. Let the circumference of a large and shallow cylindrical basin represent the equator and the central part the north polar regions. Within this cylinder let solid matter be so placed as to represent the northern halves of the continent, in such sort that the resulting configuration would correspond to that of a map of the northern hemisphere (say on the equidistant projection). Let sea-water be poured in to represent the northern portions of the terrestrial oceans. Now to represent the Arctic ice-fields, let lumps of ice be placed at the centre of the cylindrical vessel (they should be circled round by a wire-guard) and to represent the effects of equatorial heat, let a stout iron ring round and above the rim of the cylindrical vessel be heated. In this state of things the process of circulation, which actually took place in Dr. Carpenter's experiment, would take place after such modified sort as the contour of the continent masses permitted. Now suppose that the cylindrical vessel is set in steady and somewhat slow rotation about its axis. It is clear that on the currents flowing from the pole and polewards, effects will be produced which precisely resemble those due to our earth's rotation. If I am right in regarding these effects as the true cause of the direction in which the equatorial currents, the Gulf Stream, and in fact all the currents in open ocean are observed to flow, abundant evidence to that effect will be obtained.

As your two correspondents, Prof. Corfield and the Rev. Mr. Webb, like the writer of that paper, repeat the late Dr. Daubeny's most marvellous \u201cconclusion\u201d that there might have been nothing more eruptive in the phenomena than \u201cbursting out of flames\u201d from earthquake fissures, and even that the fires mentioned by Sidonius and Avitus might be \u201cdomestic conflagrations,\u201d may I briefly indicate the grounds that make these suppositions to me incredible? These fires, as named in the portions of each document that I have translated\u2014quite distinct from the conflagration of some public building on the Easter festival of a previous year, which both writers afterwards relate at greater length as an earlier and less known case of successful prayer by Mamertus, the memory of which had encouraged him under these \u201cprodigies\u201d and \u201cportents,\u201d the ignes (not incendia) that both writers make a chief or the chief part of the \u201cterrors\u201d\u2014(Sidonius, indeed, names the earthquakes before them, but Avitus twice over puts the fires first)\u2014these were crebri and assidui, continual for two or three years, yet not a word of what they fed on or what valuables they destroyed, and they were only sape flammati. Their being so sometimes is plainly named by Sidonius as an unusual and greater portent. Now, I never heard of any \u201cdomestic\u201d fires that were not \u201cflammati\u201d whereas volcanic eruptions, even severe, seldom if ever involve flame truly so called, though their strongly illuminated smoke may often by night be mistaken for flames, and has led them to be called in extreme cases, as Sidonius here said, sape flammati. He adds that when thus \u201cflammati\u201d they did, or rather threatened to do, the only mischief named as even apprehended from them at the capital, the endangering frail roofs by a load of ashes thrown over, superjecto favillarum monte. Now, surely this is not an effect of any \u00e6dile conflagrations however often repeated (a repetition that would anywhere have been regarded rather as suspicious of incendiarism than as \u201cprodigious\u201d and preternatural). Nor would any such accidents lead Avitus to ask in his sermon to those who remembered all, \u201cWho would not dread the Sodomitic showers?\u201d Again, Mr. Webb conceives that earthquakes might not only drive the wealthier part of the population out of the city, \u201cbut, as it would seem, the beasts into it!\u201d I never heard of shocks producing so singular an effect as driving any living thing into cities or buildings, and cannot conceive what natural event could so drive them, unless what is here by both witnesses implied, \u201cSodomitic showers?\u201d of hot or cumbering favill\u00e6 Such showers, which we know to be often carried, from eruptions involving no lava, scores or even hundreds of miles, in the direction of the prevailing winds, would be carried from any of the well-known cones of the For\u00e8z or Vivarais, towards, or even far beyond, Vienne; and wild animals, fleeing north-eastward, would have no refuge but under roofs; and if private house doors were habitually shut (as now in England) might crowd into the colonnades (fori latera) of that capital city. This incursion of the wild deer, bears, and wolves into towns was so well remembered as to become, in the later chroniclers, Gregory of Tours, &c., dwelt upon among the main \u201cprodig es\u201d of the time, along with the earthquakes and burnings of buildings, though any other fires cease to be implied; and the reason of this is obvious on comparing their accounts. They all copy one another, and the earliest, whose sole authorities were those two pompous and involved writers, mis-read them exactly as our moderns (except Sir F.

Mr. Webb, like the writer of that paper, repeat the late Dr. Daubeny's most marvellous \u201cconclusion\u201d that there might have been nothing more eruptive in the phenomena than \u201cbursting out of flames\u201d from earthquake fissures, and even that the fires mentioned by Sidonius and Avitus might be \u201cdomestic conflagrations,\u201d may I briefly indicate the grounds that make these suppositions to me incredible? These fires, as named in the portions of each document that I have translated\u2014quite distinct from the conflagration of some public building on the Easter festival of a previous year, which both writers afterwards relate at greater length as an earlier and less known case of successful prayer by Mamertus, the memory of which had encouraged him under these \u201cprodigies\u201d and \u201cportents,\u201d the ignes (not incendia) that both writers make a chief or the chief part of the \u201cterrors\u201d\u2014(Sidonius, indeed, names the earthquakes before them, but Avitus twice over puts the fires first)\u2014these were crebri and assidui, continual for two or three years, yet not a word of what they fed on or what valuables they destroyed, and they were only sape flammati. Their being so sometimes is plainly named by Sidonius as an unusual and greater portent. Now, I never heard of any \u201cdomestic\u201d fires that were not \u201cflammati\u201d whereas volcanic eruptions, even severe, seldom if ever involve flame truly so called, though their strongly illuminated smoke may often by night be mistaken for flames, and has led them to be called in extreme cases, as Sidonius here said, sape flammati. He adds that when thus \u201cflammati\u201d they did, or rather threatened to do, the only mischief named as even apprehended from them at the capital, the endangering frail roofs by a load of ashes thrown over, superjecto favillarum monte. Now, surely this is not an effect of any \u00e6dile conflagrations however often repeated (a repetition that would anywhere have been regarded rather as suspicious of incendiarism than as \u201cprodigious\u201d and preternatural). Nor would any such accidents lead Avitus to ask in his sermon to those who remembered all, \u201cWho would not dread the Sodomitic showers?\u201d Again, Mr. Webb conceives that earthquakes might not only drive the wealthier part of the population out of the city, \u201cbut, as it would seem, the beasts into it!\u201d I never heard of shocks producing so singular an effect as driving any living thing into cities or buildings, and cannot conceive what natural event could so drive them, unless what is here by both witnesses implied, \u201cSodomitic showers?\u201d of hot or cumbering favill\u00e6 Such showers, which we know to be often carried, from eruptions involving no lava, scores or even hundreds of miles, in the direction of the prevailing winds, would be carried from any of the well-known cones of the For\u00e8z or Vivarais, towards, or even far beyond, Vienne; and wild animals, fleeing north-eastward, would have no refuge but under roofs; and if private house doors were habitually shut (as now in England) might crowd into the colonnades (fori latera) of that capital city. This incursion of the wild deer, bears, and wolves into towns was so well remembered as to become, in the later chroniclers, Gregory of Tours, &c., dwelt upon among the main \u201cprodig es\u201d of the time, along with the earthquakes and burnings of buildings, though any other fires cease to be implied; and the reason of this is obvious on comparing their accounts. They all copy one another, and the earliest, whose sole authorities were those two pompous and involved writers, mis-read them exactly as our moderns (except Sir F. Palgrave) appear to have done, confusing together the fires of the \u201cprodigies,\u201d that led to the Rogation fasts with the earlier \u00e6dile conflagration at some Easter, said to have been prayed out by Mamertus, which occupies both the writer and preacher immediately after, and at greater length than these well-known \u201cterrors\u201d remembered by those they addressed personally.","dc.creator":["GARBETT, E.

This has been clearly proved to be the case by Mr. Spalding with chickens and turkeys just born, in his admirable article recently published in Macmillan's Magazine.

Other instincts may have arisen suddenly in an individual and then been transmitted to its offspring, independently both of selection and serviceable experience, though, subsequently strengthened by habit.

In the following case we see a specialised feeling of antipathy transmitted through three generations of dogs, as well as to some collateral members of the same family, and which must have been acquired within a very recent period. Unfortunately it is not known how the feeling first arose in the grandfather of Dr. Huggins's dog. We may suspect that it was due to some ill-treatment; but it may have originated without any assignable cause, as with certain animals in the Zoological Gardens, which, as I am assured by Mr. Bartlett, have taken a strong hatred to him and others without any provocation.

So remarkable is it that I am induced to give you a short description. As you enter the room to the left, the first thing to attract the attention of the pal\u00e6ontologist was the collection contained in a case of about 12 ft, long by 3ft. wide, filled to repletion with the fossil bones of the \u201cGreat Horsham Iguanodon\u201d and the \u201cTower Hill Iguanodon,\u201d and various other bones. There were the fibula, scapula, and caracoid of Iguanodon in juxtaposition with the humerus belonging to the same specimen, the jaw of the young Iguarodon and the caudal vertebr\u00e6, all figured and described in the monographs of the Pal\u00e6ontographical Society. Also the Hawksbourne, femur, and tibia with metatarsals and a distal phalanx, and various other vertebr\u00e6, teeth and phalanges. The jaw of a very young Megalosaurus which evidently perished very shortly after its escape from the egg. The tibia, supposed scapula, and various other bones and teeth of Megalosaurus, the ribs, vertebr\u00e6, and teeth of Hyl\u00e6osaurus. The jaw and other remains of a young Suchosaurus cultridens not long escaped from the shell, and teeth of Suchosaurus, a fine vertebr\u00e6 of Streptospondylian type found with the \u201cGreat Horsham Iguanodon,\u201d and a femur of a young crocodile. The muzzle and portions of jaws, teeth, vertebr\u00e6, scutes, and various other bones of Goniopholis crassidens. This specimen shows the succession of three teeth. This specimen was borrowed in 1842 by a well-known pal\u00e6ontologist for the purpose of illustration and description. Three artists were employed, who executed five quarto plates of the various portions, but they have never yet been published. Seventeen specimens have not been returned. A younger and very beautiful specimen of Goniopholis crassidens in its matrix of stone is missing from this collection. It was borrowed shortly after the above specimen and lithographed at once. It has unfortunately made its escape from custody. It is clear from the specimens shown that the armour of Goniopholis was far more perfect than that of any other living or extinct crocodilian. The toothed and imbricated scutes were in connection with others of a hexagonal or pentagonal shape, which were suturaliy united. The abdominal scutes overlapped each other on one side. Besides these there are several bones of Pterodactyl, the vertebr\u00e6, ribs and teeth of Plesiosaurus, a fine jaw of a beaver, various pubic and tympanic bones, and the pubic bone of a saurian described by Dr. Mantell, bones of turtles and many other bones, too numerous to mention, and some of most gigantic size, and in a wonderful state of preservation.

Angstr\u00f6m and Thalen, on which I should like to make a few remarks. It is known that Pl\u00fccker first drew attention to the fact that one body may have different spectra, and he seemed inclined to attribute these spectra to different allotropic states of the element. Later on, however, attempts were made to give another explanation of the phenomenon. It is against these attempts that Angstr\u00f6m and Thalen chiefly protest in their paper. They use, however, the word element, in a different sense from that in which it is generally used. An elementary body, they say, can only have one spectrum. We are aware that bodies, as iodine and sulphur, can give two spectra, but then the band spectrum is due to an allotropic state, which, from a spectroscopic point of view, behaves like a compound body. It would seem from this and other remarks, that, from a spectroscopic point of view at least, they consider an element to be not only a body which cannot be decomposed into two different bodies, but a body which cannot be resolved into any simpler molecular state. I have no objection against this if it is always clearly understood that our authors include allotropic states under the denomination of compounds. For instance, they lay great stress on the fact that a spectrum of fluted bands is always characteristic of a compound body. According to their definition of a compound this is perfectly correct, for no doubt the band spectrum belongs to a more complicated molecular state, but they cannot bring this argument forward as tending to show that Swan's spectrum of the candle belongs to a hydrocarbon, or that the fluted spectrum of nitrogen belongs to an oxide of nitrogen. The fact simply means that the molecule which gives these band spectra is to the molecule which gives the line spectra as the molecule which gives the absorption bands of iodine is to the molecule which gives the lines of iodine.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"15","prism.number":"386","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"447","prism.endingPage":"448","prism.copyright":"1877 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/015447d0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/015447d0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/015447d0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/015447d0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Spectra of Metalloids","citation_volume":"15","citation_issue":"386","citation_publication_date":"1877/03","citation_firstpage":"447","citation_lastpage":"448","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/015447d0","DOI":"10.1038/015447d0","citation_doi":"10.1038/015447d0","description":"IN a recent number of NATURE (vol. xv., p. 401) I gave a short abstract of a paper by Messrs.

For my own part I can conceive of few nobler aims than that of raising for one's town a permanent public institution of an intellectual character. If a committee were to take up the work with enthusiasm and were able, even though after many years of toil, to say to the people of Hastings: We have built for you, with your own help, a library and museum, and we have, with funds with which the public have supplied us, sufficiently endowed this institution to carry on all its legitimate work, and we now hand it over to you, the people of the town of Hastings, as the property of you and your children for ever\u2014I say a committee that took in hand and accomplished such a work would deserve the deepest gratitude of the borough, and would have a light to claim to have accomplished a mission of no small importance.\"","dc.creator":["R., A."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["R., A."],"citation_author_institution":["Hastings"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Local Museums","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Local Museums&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"016361c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

There was a rich shower of Aquarids from a point near Aquarii, at R.A. 343\u00b0, 14\u00b0 S. declination, which gave twenty-two meteors. These were rather bright, not very swift, with moderately long paths (averaging 17\u00b0), and quite devoid of streaks. I had seen about five meteors of this system on the preceding night, and on the 28th I watched a very hazy condition of sky\u2014in which the stars shone dimly\u2014for four hours, and of forty-four meteors seen five or six others were Aquarids. This active shower was well seen by Capt. Tupman on July 27, 1870, with an accurately-defined radiant at 340\u00b0\u201414\u00b0, from fourteen meteors (see No. 43 of his catalogue), and on the four following nights he traced about forty-seven others from the same shower, though the centre seemed a little further south, at 340\u00b0\u201419\u00b0 on the 28th. On the 27th he recorded seven meteors of this stream within the twenty-one minutes, from 14h. 3m. to 14h. 24m. It was also seen by me, at 342\u00b0\u201412\u00b0 (ten meteors), on August 3-17 last year; and Schmidt gives radiants at 337\u00b0\u201411\u00b0 for July 20-31, and at 344\u00b0\u201411\u00b0 for August.

The average centre from these eight independent determinations is at 340\u00b0\u201413\u00b0 for this important shower, which evidently comes to a strong maximum on about July 27-29. The end of July has long been known as a meteor-epoch of considerable intensity, with a maximum, according to Quetelet, between the 27th and 29th, which is thus amply confirmed by recent observations, and proves these Aquarids to be but little less in importance to the annually-recurring showers of Lyrids, Orionids, Taurids, and Geminids.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"18","prism.number":"457","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"356","prism.endingPage":"356","prism.copyright":"1878 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/018356b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/018356b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/018356b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/018356b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Meteor Shower of Aquarids (July)","citation_volume":"18","citation_issue":"457","citation_publication_date":"1878/08","citation_firstpage":"356","citation_lastpage":"356","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/018356b0","DOI":"10.1038/018356b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/018356b0","description":"ON July 27 ninety-three shooting stars were seen here, between 10h. 30m. and 14h. 30m., which, after making allowance for time occupied in charting the paths, is equivalent to about twenty-nine per hour for one observer.

The magnitude of this star is, however, smaller than that given by Mr. Watson, that in the British Association Catalogue being 5\u00bd, and that in Argelander's Uranometria Nova 6.

I shuld not attempts to oppose so distinguished a naturalist on points of biological inference, but I venture to defend the accuracy of my statements of fact.","dc.creator":["ALLEN, GRANT"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["ALLEN, GRANT"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Colour in Nature","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Colour in Nature&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"020077d0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Yielding, or flowing, seems to occur in all metals after a certain limiting stress has been reached; indeed it probably occurs, although perhaps to an immeasurably small extent, even with small stresses (see Proc. Roy. Soc. No. 204, p. 411, 1880); but there is generally a limiting stress beyond which the increase of strain due to yielding becomes comparable in magnitude with the ordinary strains, which instantaneously disappear on the removal of the load. The bell-smith pulls his copper wire, and makes it much longer before he thinks it fit for use; in a similar way the telegraph constructor stretches, or kills the iron wire before he erects the line. Up to a certain limit of pulling force, the wire obeys the well-known laws of elasticity; slightly above that limit there is considerable fluid-yielding, there being but very little yielding below that limit; and at any instant during the lengthening if the man ceases to pull, the wire shortens a little. In fact at any stage the wire obeys the elastic law for small stresses. Eventually the man ceases to pull, knowing that the metal has lost most of its fluid properties, which can only be restored to it by annealing. The same thing occurs in brass, although to a smaller extent than in copper, which can be experimentally proved in the following way:\u2014 Stretch a piece of well-annealed brass wire in the manner described by Major Herschel until it is nearly breaking; and immediately set the wire vibrating. Now the note given out by the stretched brass wire, which, as is well known, depends on the tensile stress, will be found rapidly to go down in pitch. If the wire be tightened up again sufficiently with the screw, the original note will again be heard, and the pitch will again go down, but not so rapidly as before. Repeat this process until no flattening of the note is heard; then in this state we think that the experimenter will find the wire to break with much less torsion than before, and to obey Hooke's law more exactly. If it be desired to repeat the yielding or flowing process, the wire must be previously again annealed.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"22","prism.number":"574","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"604","prism.endingPage":"605","prism.copyright":"1880 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/022604a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/022604a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/022604a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/022604a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Wire Torsion","citation_volume":"22","citation_issue":"574","citation_publication_date":"1880/10","citation_firstpage":"604","citation_lastpage":"605","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/022604a0","DOI":"10.1038/022604a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/022604a0","description":"THE phenomena described by Major Herschel in his letter to NATURE, vol. xxii. p. 557, and about which he asks for information, are, we think, quite easily explained by what is known of the fluidity of metals.

FIEVEZ, the Astronomer adjoint at the Royal Observatory, Brussels, has been good enough to send me a copy of his note on the analysis of the light of this comet, made with the 15-inch Merz-Cooke equatorial, provisionally installed at the Avenue Cortenberg. The polariscopic observations demonstrate that the polarisation of the nucleus was strong (tr\u00e8s nette et bein accentu\u00e9e), while that of the tail was very weak. These observations were made at several days interval, from 11h. till midnight. Sky polarisation was scarcely sensible. The spectroscopic observations proved the spectrum of the comet to consist of four bands of intensity in the following order: green, blue, violet, and yellow, with wave-lengths 5160, 4780, 4200 (about), and 5620. The original appearance of these bands was modified as the comet receded from the sun, their edges towards the red then becoming more and more defined. The nucleus presented a brilliant continuous spectrum, in which however the Fraunhofer lines were not recognised. The conclusions arrived at by M. Fievez were as follows:\u2014 That a great part of the light of the comet was inherent to it, while the other part was reflected solar light. That the strong polarisation of the nucleus indicated a marked state of condensation of the matter composing it. That the spectrum differed little from that of other comets. Lastly, that the marked modifications in the brilliancy of the continuous spectrum, and in the appearance of the spectrum bands indicated a progressive diminution in the tail as compared with that found by Prof. A. W. Wright and Mr. Cowper Ranyard, and in the absence of the Fraunhofer line, which were measured by Dr. N. de Konkoly, and also photographed by Dr. Huggins. Whence, we may ask, arises the divergence of conclusions arrived at by M.

The answer lies, I think, not with the instruments employed, but rather in the interesting probability of change in the comet's structure or condition during the time of its examination. A comparison of the many observations recorded during its stay with us may possibly lead to important discoveries in this direction. I am much interested to see that Prof. C. A.

Catharina in Brazil, dated August 9, supports the view which I have advanced with respect to leaves placing themselves in a vertical position at night, during their so-called sleep, in order to escape being chilled and injured by radiation into the open sky. He says: \u201cWe have had last week some rather cold nights (2\u00b0 to 3\u00b0 C. at sunrise), and these have given me a new confirmation of your view on the meaning of the nyctitropic movements of plants.

Their references reach some thirteen years back; but if they will look further they will find the late discoveries (including those of Hildebrand and Zimmerman in Pringsheim's Jahrb\u00fccher) forestalled as to Erodium by nearly half a century. In the Magazine of Natural History for 1836 is a modest contribution of nearly two pages from Robert Mallet of Capell Street, Dublin, describing and figuring his observations on the achenial awns of Erodium moschatum and Pelargonium peltatum. He finds that the awns of Erodium possess \u201cmost wonderful hygrometric sensibility.\u201d The five awns lie in grooves of the carpophore. He gives transverse views of the awns in various conditions of torsion, and of the carpophore (not as well executed as the similar ones of F. Darwin and Hildebrand).

Their references reach some thirteen years back; but if they will look further they will find the late discoveries (including those of Hildebrand and Zimmerman in Pringsheim's Jahrb\u00fccher) forestalled as to Erodium by nearly half a century. In the Magazine of Natural History for 1836 is a modest contribution of nearly two pages from Robert Mallet of Capell Street, Dublin, describing and figuring his observations on the achenial awns of Erodium moschatum and Pelargonium peltatum. He finds that the awns of Erodium possess \u201cmost wonderful hygrometric sensibility.\u201d The five awns lie in grooves of the carpophore. He gives transverse views of the awns in various conditions of torsion, and of the carpophore (not as well executed as the similar ones of F. Darwin and Hildebrand). He states that aridity causes the awns to twist, and so to extricate themselves from their grooves, and at the same time downy filaments bristle forth from the awns, and the achenes detach themselves and fall to the ground. Here the awns still continue to twist and keep tumbling over, so as to recede from the parent plant. At last by twisting they become like balloons wafted about by every zephyr. But motive power has not ceased with the awn: the slighest hygrometric change produces motion either backwards or forwards in it; and the constant tendency of this motion is to screw the seed into the ground (Mr. Mallet's italics).

The question as to the geological position of the limestone series in West Rossshire, correlated by Murchison with the Durness limestone, is one to which I devoted special attention during my late visit to the neighbourhoods of Lochs Carron, Doule, Kishorn, and Maree. The general appearance of the limestone in these areas is sufficiently like that of Durness to lead to the supposition that it is of the same age, but this of course can only be proved by fossil evidence. The conclusion at which I have arrived, however, in regard to the geological position of the limestone, and as to its relation to the so-called Upper Gneiss rocks of the central parts of Ross-shire, is in direct opposition to the views of Murchison, and accords in the main with that of Prof. Nicol.

The question as to the geological position of the limestone series in West Rossshire, correlated by Murchison with the Durness limestone, is one to which I devoted special attention during my late visit to the neighbourhoods of Lochs Carron, Doule, Kishorn, and Maree. The general appearance of the limestone in these areas is sufficiently like that of Durness to lead to the supposition that it is of the same age, but this of course can only be proved by fossil evidence. The conclusion at which I have arrived, however, in regard to the geological position of the limestone, and as to its relation to the so-called Upper Gneiss rocks of the central parts of Ross-shire, is in direct opposition to the views of Murchison, and accords in the main with that of Prof. Nicol. The great triangular patch at the head of Loch Kishorn consists of a series of thick beds of grey limestone, with a few bands of sandstone in an unaltered condition, and is undoubtedly dropped by faults amongst much older strata, as maintained by Prof. Nicol.

In a paper read before the California Academy of Sciences in 1870 (see Proceedings, vol. iv. p. 128), I pointed out that our extreme seasonal climates were caused by the prevalence of broad belts of north and south winds which would extend continuously from east to west for 1500 or 2000 miles, and would blow over the same surface for months together, causing extreme seasons with temperatures above the average where the south current prevailed, and cold winters where there was a northerly current.","dc.creator":["BLAKE, JAMES"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["BLAKE, JAMES"],"citation_author_institution":["San Francisco"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Cold and Sunspots","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Cold and Sunspots&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"028342a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The substance is perfectly free from olivine, at all events neither olivine nor serpentine has been discovered under microscopical analysis.","dc.creator":["PETTERSEN, KARL"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["PETTERSEN, KARL"],"citation_author_institution":["Tromso Museum, Finmarken, Norway"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"A New Rock","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;A New Rock&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"029336b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

T. Cunningham, records as a novelty the finding in 1883 of Actinotrocha off Cromarty Firth. Without giving an exhaustive note of its occurrence off our shores since the discovery in 1856 of Phoronis by the late able and accomplished Dr. Strethill Wright, viz. one species fromi Ilfracombe, and another on an oyster-shell from the neighbourhood of Inchkeith in the Firth of Forth, the following remarks may be of interest. So long ago as 1858 the late Dr. Spencer Cobbold found Actinotrocha near Portobello, as was likely after Dr. Wright's discovery, and I have also since met with it in and off the Forth. Moreover, at the meeting of the Microscopical Society at which Dr. Cobbold read his paper, the lamented Dr. Carpenter mentioned that he had found Actinotrocha in abundance off the Island of Arran, probably when working at Tomopteris and other surface-forms with his friend, the enthusiastic E. Clapar\u00e8de, of Geneva. Besides these localities, Prof. K\u00f6lliker (\u201cKurzer Bericht an der westk\u00fcste von Schottland,\u201d Zeitsch. f. w. Zool., Bd. v. 1864) describes the occurrence of a Phoronis apparently identical with Dr. Wright's P. hippocrepia from Millport on the larger Cumbrae in the Clyde, a region in which the steam-yacht Medusa from Granton has lately been at work. It is probable, indeed, that Phoronis and its larval form (Actinotrocha) are more generally distributed round our shores than the scanty notices of them would lead one to suppose.

Without giving an exhaustive note of its occurrence off our shores since the discovery in 1856 of Phoronis by the late able and accomplished Dr. Strethill Wright, viz. one species fromi Ilfracombe, and another on an oyster-shell from the neighbourhood of Inchkeith in the Firth of Forth, the following remarks may be of interest. So long ago as 1858 the late Dr. Spencer Cobbold found Actinotrocha near Portobello, as was likely after Dr. Wright's discovery, and I have also since met with it in and off the Forth. Moreover, at the meeting of the Microscopical Society at which Dr. Cobbold read his paper, the lamented Dr. Carpenter mentioned that he had found Actinotrocha in abundance off the Island of Arran, probably when working at Tomopteris and other surface-forms with his friend, the enthusiastic E. Clapar\u00e8de, of Geneva. Besides these localities, Prof. K\u00f6lliker (\u201cKurzer Bericht an der westk\u00fcste von Schottland,\u201d Zeitsch. f. w. Zool., Bd. v. 1864) describes the occurrence of a Phoronis apparently identical with Dr. Wright's P. hippocrepia from Millport on the larger Cumbrae in the Clyde, a region in which the steam-yacht Medusa from Granton has lately been at work. It is probable, indeed, that Phoronis and its larval form (Actinotrocha) are more generally distributed round our shores than the scanty notices of them would lead one to suppose. Old shells in and off the mouth of the Forth, off the western shores, and these and other structures in the littoral region on the southern coast of England, as well as the shores of the Channel Islands, will probably produce many examples of Phoronis, while the careful scrutiny of the contents of the tow-net in similar localities will yield corresponding results as regards Actinotrocha.","dc.creator":["MCINTOSH, W.

Since the above date, I have considerably extended my research, with results that confirm the conviction therein expressed that many of the most disastrous colliery explosions during the last seven years in this northern district have been practically dust explosions, and therefore preventable; that the rough method of watering the floors only, or floors and sides, of the mines is delusive, since it leaves the most dangerous dust undisturbed, the upper and flocculent dust; and last, that probably the reasons why dust in dry pits does not explode more frequently are now within grasp. To this latter conclusion, with your permission, I will now briefly address myself. That every firing of a shot that is accompanied by flame in a dry and dusty pit does not produce an explosion is well known; that sometimes such firing of a shot does is unhappily also well known. That the local presence of gas, even in small amount, is sometimes the reason of this is universally acknowledged. That the amount and condition of the dust present (even in the practical absence of gas) is at other times the reason is now believed by many. Setting aside the amount of dust, which every one will allow must be an essential factor, and also the varying energy which the shot, blown out or not, develops, let us look at the other conditions. The temperature and hygroscopic state of the air-current is one most important factor, and consequently the concomitant temperature and hygroscopic state of the dust traversed by such current. Beyond this, the degree of fineness and the constituents of the dust will have much to say in the matter.

Since the above date, I have considerably extended my research, with results that confirm the conviction therein expressed that many of the most disastrous colliery explosions during the last seven years in this northern district have been practically dust explosions, and therefore preventable; that the rough method of watering the floors only, or floors and sides, of the mines is delusive, since it leaves the most dangerous dust undisturbed, the upper and flocculent dust; and last, that probably the reasons why dust in dry pits does not explode more frequently are now within grasp. To this latter conclusion, with your permission, I will now briefly address myself. That every firing of a shot that is accompanied by flame in a dry and dusty pit does not produce an explosion is well known; that sometimes such firing of a shot does is unhappily also well known. That the local presence of gas, even in small amount, is sometimes the reason of this is universally acknowledged. That the amount and condition of the dust present (even in the practical absence of gas) is at other times the reason is now believed by many. Setting aside the amount of dust, which every one will allow must be an essential factor, and also the varying energy which the shot, blown out or not, develops, let us look at the other conditions. The temperature and hygroscopic state of the air-current is one most important factor, and consequently the concomitant temperature and hygroscopic state of the dust traversed by such current. Beyond this, the degree of fineness and the constituents of the dust will have much to say in the matter. The finer the particles the more readily will they ignite, and the more completely will they place their substance under the influences present. Thus ordinary screen coal-dust will not ignite when a common match is lighted and applied to it, but it will when finely pounded in a mortar. Now the dust resting on the baulks and upper portions generally of the ways will invariably so light and burn when dry, although the constituents vary greatly in different pits and in different seams of the same pit.","dc.creator":["WATTS, ARTHUR"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["WATTS, ARTHUR"],"citation_author_institution":["Bede College, Durham"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Relation of Coal-Dust to Explosions in Mines","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Relation of Coal-Dust to Explosions in Mines&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"036294a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Lond. Math. Soc., April 11, 1889), Prof. Karl Pearson has discussed at some length the possible forms of the additional terms which may be introduced into the general equations of elasticity by a consideration of the mutual action of the molecules and the ether, and has examined what physical phenomena may admit of explanation in this way. In particular, certain terms which thus appear admissible are made to yield a theory of the phenomenon known as \u201celastische Nachwirkung,\u201d or \u201cafter-strain.\u201d The attempt to explain such a comparatively slow process by the intervention of the ether certainly invites scrutiny, and in fact a very slight examination serves, I think, to show that the theory in question rests on a mistake. The author, after writing down the equations which (on his view) represent the steady application of stress to a portion of matter, proceeds to integrate them in the usual way by assuming a time-factor emt, and arrives at a quadratic in m2 whose roots are \u03bc/\u03bc' and (3\u03bb + 2\u03bc)/(3\u03bb' + 2\u03bc'), where \u03bb, \u03bc are the ordinary elastic constants of Lam\u00e9, and \u03bb', \u03bc' are the coefficients of the additional terms referred to. He continues:\u2014\u201cNow m cannot be positive, so long at least as we are dealing with elastic-strain. For \u03bb' and \u03bc' are small as compared with \u03bb and \u03bc, the effects we are considering being only of the second order. Hence m2 is large, and if m were positive the strain would rapidly grow immensely large, which is contrary to experience. Thus, we must give m the negative values \u2013 \u221a(\u03bc/\u03bc') and \u2013 \u221a{(3\u03bb + 2\u03bc)/(3\u03bb' + 2\u03bc')}.\u201d The positive values of m are certainly inconvenient, but they are on the same footing with the negative ones; all are solutions of the author's equations, and all are required for the purpose of satisfying arbitrary initial conditions.

The sound is, I find, produced from bees in search of the Aphis secretions on the leaves of the beeches, the under sides of which are sticky with the substance.

MacAulay and Tait, from an expectation that Prof. Gibbs would have something to say. In this I have not been mistaken; and, as there is a general agreement between us on the whole, I have merely to add some supplementary remarks. Prof. MacAulay refers to me as having raised the question again. I can assure him it has never been dropped. Apart from the one-sided discussion, it has been a live question with Prof. Gibbs and myself since about 1882, and is now more alive than ever. I cannot help thinking that Prof. MacAulay's letter was overhastily written, and feel sure that if he knew as much about the views and methods of those to whom he appeals as he does about Quaternions, he would have written it somewhat differently, or perhaps not have written it at all, from a conviction of the uselessness of his appeal. There is no question of suicide with us on the contrary, quite the reverse. I am asked whether the \u201cspoonfeeding,\u201d as he terms it, of Maxwell, Fitzgerald, &c., is not good enough for me. Why, of course not. It is quaternionic, and that is the real point concerned. Again, he thinks nothing of the inscrutable negativity of the square of a vector in Quaternions; here, again, is the root of the evil. As regards a uniformity of notation amongst antiquaternionists, I dare say that will come in time, but the proposal is premature. We have fist to get people to study the matter and think about it. I have developed my system, such as it is, quite independently of Prof. Gibbs. Nevertheless, I would willingly adopt his notation (as I have adopted his dyadical notion of the linear operator) if I found it better. But I do not. I have been particularly careful in my notation to harmonise as closely as possible with ordinary mathematical ideas, processes, and notation; I do not think Gibbs has succeeded so well. But that matters little now; the really important thing is to depose the quaternion from the masterful position it has so long usurped, whereby the diffusion of vector analysis has been so lamentably impeded. I have been, until lately, very tender and merciful towards quaternionic fads, thinking it possible that Prof. Tait might modify his obstructive attitude. But there is seemingly no chance of that. Whether this be so or not, I think it is practically certain that there is no chance whatever for Quaternions as a practical system of mathematics for the use of physicists. How is it possible, when it is so utterly discordant with physical notions, besides being at variance with common mathematics?

MacAulay and Tait, from an expectation that Prof. Gibbs would have something to say. In this I have not been mistaken; and, as there is a general agreement between us on the whole, I have merely to add some supplementary remarks. Prof. MacAulay refers to me as having raised the question again. I can assure him it has never been dropped. Apart from the one-sided discussion, it has been a live question with Prof. Gibbs and myself since about 1882, and is now more alive than ever. I cannot help thinking that Prof. MacAulay's letter was overhastily written, and feel sure that if he knew as much about the views and methods of those to whom he appeals as he does about Quaternions, he would have written it somewhat differently, or perhaps not have written it at all, from a conviction of the uselessness of his appeal. There is no question of suicide with us on the contrary, quite the reverse. I am asked whether the \u201cspoonfeeding,\u201d as he terms it, of Maxwell, Fitzgerald, &c., is not good enough for me. Why, of course not. It is quaternionic, and that is the real point concerned. Again, he thinks nothing of the inscrutable negativity of the square of a vector in Quaternions; here, again, is the root of the evil. As regards a uniformity of notation amongst antiquaternionists, I dare say that will come in time, but the proposal is premature. We have fist to get people to study the matter and think about it. I have developed my system, such as it is, quite independently of Prof. Gibbs. Nevertheless, I would willingly adopt his notation (as I have adopted his dyadical notion of the linear operator) if I found it better. But I do not. I have been particularly careful in my notation to harmonise as closely as possible with ordinary mathematical ideas, processes, and notation; I do not think Gibbs has succeeded so well. But that matters little now; the really important thing is to depose the quaternion from the masterful position it has so long usurped, whereby the diffusion of vector analysis has been so lamentably impeded. I have been, until lately, very tender and merciful towards quaternionic fads, thinking it possible that Prof. Tait might modify his obstructive attitude. But there is seemingly no chance of that. Whether this be so or not, I think it is practically certain that there is no chance whatever for Quaternions as a practical system of mathematics for the use of physicists. How is it possible, when it is so utterly discordant with physical notions, besides being at variance with common mathematics? A vector is not a quaternion; it never was, and never will be, and its square is not negative; the supposed proofs are perfectly rotten at the core. Vector-analysis should have a purely vectorial basis, and the quaternion will then, if wanted at all, merely come in as an occasional auxiliary, as a special kind of operator. It is to Prof. Tait's devotion to his master that we should look for the reason of the little progress made in the last 20 years in spreading vector-analysis.","dc.creator":["HEAVISIDE, OLIVER"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["HEAVISIDE, OLIVER"],"citation_author_institution":["Paignton, Devon"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Vectors Versus Quaternions","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Vectors &lt;Emphasis Type=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Versus&lt;/Emphasis&gt;...","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"048077d0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

If the egg is not fertilised at this time \u2026 parthenogenetic germination begins to make its appearance \u2026 It may be accepted as a law of nature (italics mine) for mammals, and for the majority of other organisms, that their male and female sexual cells are absolutely incapable of development by themselves.\u201d Thus, what occurs in the lower organisms is no criterion of what occurs in the higher, and vice vers\u00e2. Then why does Hertwig remark (p. 348), \u201cIt is quite sufficient for our purpose to acknowledge, that in the plants and lower animals, all the cells which are derived from the ovum contain equal quantities of the hereditary mass.\u2026 All idioblasts must divide and must be transmitted to the daughter-cells, in equal proportions both as regards quality and quantity\u201d (italics mine). According to the above, it is \u201cquite sufficient\u201d for Hertwig's purpose of discrediting Weismann's contention for differentiated distribution of hereditary elements among somatic cells, to show that there is undifferentiated distribution in the case of plants and lower animals. But, reverting to the earlier quotation, if it is not sufficient to prove sexual reproduction in the case of the higher organisms, in order to disprove parthenogenesis in the case of the lower organisms, why should it be \u201cquite sufficient,\u201d in order to disprove distribution through germ-cells, in the case of the higher organisms, to show that, in plants and the lower animals one cell contains the same hereditary constituents as another? It is permissible to infer that differentiation in regard to germ-cells, in the higher animals, is no more disproved by the assumed demonstration that, in plants and the lower animals, there is no such differentiation, than that asexuality in lower is disproved by sexuality in higher organisms. Weismann, in my opinion, has proved to rational satisfaction that differentiation of germ from other cells must occur in the higher organisms, and he has offered a rational explanation, conformable with the theory of germ-plasm, of the apparently summational distribution of hereditary elements through somatic cells. Until Weismann's position is seriously undermined, which, so far, is not even a likely contingency, we must decline to accept Hertwig's assumed demonstrations in regard to plants and lower animals as invalidating the theory of germ-plasm. Similarly, that environment may affect the hereditary character of a primitive organism is no more evidence that it may so affect a mammal, than sexuality in the latter is evidence against parthenogenesis in the former.

If the egg is not fertilised at this time \u2026 parthenogenetic germination begins to make its appearance \u2026 It may be accepted as a law of nature (italics mine) for mammals, and for the majority of other organisms, that their male and female sexual cells are absolutely incapable of development by themselves.\u201d Thus, what occurs in the lower organisms is no criterion of what occurs in the higher, and vice vers\u00e2. Then why does Hertwig remark (p. 348), \u201cIt is quite sufficient for our purpose to acknowledge, that in the plants and lower animals, all the cells which are derived from the ovum contain equal quantities of the hereditary mass.\u2026 All idioblasts must divide and must be transmitted to the daughter-cells, in equal proportions both as regards quality and quantity\u201d (italics mine). According to the above, it is \u201cquite sufficient\u201d for Hertwig's purpose of discrediting Weismann's contention for differentiated distribution of hereditary elements among somatic cells, to show that there is undifferentiated distribution in the case of plants and lower animals. But, reverting to the earlier quotation, if it is not sufficient to prove sexual reproduction in the case of the higher organisms, in order to disprove parthenogenesis in the case of the lower organisms, why should it be \u201cquite sufficient,\u201d in order to disprove distribution through germ-cells, in the case of the higher organisms, to show that, in plants and the lower animals one cell contains the same hereditary constituents as another? It is permissible to infer that differentiation in regard to germ-cells, in the higher animals, is no more disproved by the assumed demonstration that, in plants and the lower animals, there is no such differentiation, than that asexuality in lower is disproved by sexuality in higher organisms. Weismann, in my opinion, has proved to rational satisfaction that differentiation of germ from other cells must occur in the higher organisms, and he has offered a rational explanation, conformable with the theory of germ-plasm, of the apparently summational distribution of hereditary elements through somatic cells. Until Weismann's position is seriously undermined, which, so far, is not even a likely contingency, we must decline to accept Hertwig's assumed demonstrations in regard to plants and lower animals as invalidating the theory of germ-plasm. Similarly, that environment may affect the hereditary character of a primitive organism is no more evidence that it may so affect a mammal, than sexuality in the latter is evidence against parthenogenesis in the former.

At this stage I only desire to say that I quite agree with Prof. Ray Lankester, as I stated at the meeting of the Linnean Society, with respect to the contention that the specific characters of the systematist are not necessarily those upon which natural selection has directly acted in bringing about the specific differentiation. These external visible or measurable characters may be, and I believe often are, the outward expression of internal differences of constitution with which the external characters are correlated.

If future observation should show that there is no selection at work upon the young stages, weeding out the individuals whose breadth of carapace falls below a certain standard, but (according to the alternative) that the individuals get broader as they grow older, then it appears to me that the measurements may still be interpreted as indicating the action of selection; only the selection would have done its work in the past history of the species, instead of acting now, as on the original assumption. In other words, breadth of carapace (or some character correlated with it) had a selection value in the phylogeny; now this character appears at a late stage in the ontogeny.

H. McMahon, of the features of the country on the southern borderlands of Afghanistan, which appears in the Geographical Journal for this month (April 1897, p. 393), he gives an account of a remarkable trench, or depression, running in a nearly N.N.E. and S.S.W. direction along the borders of Registan, which he was able to trace for 120 miles, but which may extend for a much greater distance through that wild region, and he clearly identifies it as the line of a large fault dividing a district composed of sedimentary rocks on the east, from one formed of igneous rocks on the west. On reading this account, the resemblance of this line of fracture to that of the Jordan-Arabah Valley at once suggested itself to my mind. The resemblance is nearly complete as regards the latter, from the head of the Gulf of Akabah as far as the northern end of the Dead Sea, at least; except in this respect, that in the case of the Jordan-Arabah fault the sedimentary rocks occur on the west side, and the igneous rocks on the east.

As far as actual observation goes, that of the Jordan-Arabah Valley is much longer; for, measured only from the head of the Gulf of Akabah to the base of Hermon, it has a length of 270 miles or more; while there can be little doubt that it ranges still further north into the valley of C\u0153le-Syria. In the opposite direction, it may well be supposed that it follows the Gulf of Akabah for an unknown distance. It will thus be seen that the fault-line of the Jordan-Arabah Valley is very much longer than that of the border of Registan, described by Captain McMahon, as far as actual observation is concerned.

The colour obtained from smutty oats, for example, is of a deep rich umber shade, sometimes approaching to sepia in tone. Satisfactory experiments were made regarding its fastness to light and atmospheric influences. Specimens of the pigment painted on paper as a water-colour were exposed to direct sunlight for several months; and after this rather severe trial, they were compared with unexposed duplicate specimens. Little change in the appearance of the colours was apparent. With mild diffused daylight\u2014such as that of an ordinary, well-illumined room\u2014the colour remains quite fast and unaltered. Experiments were made on a small scale with oat smut pigment, and the results seemed highly satisfactory. Several grams of the dry spore dust were collected from smutty oats, and it was found that twelve heads of such oats yielded six grams of the brownish-black dust.

The colour obtained from smutty oats, for example, is of a deep rich umber shade, sometimes approaching to sepia in tone. Satisfactory experiments were made regarding its fastness to light and atmospheric influences. Specimens of the pigment painted on paper as a water-colour were exposed to direct sunlight for several months; and after this rather severe trial, they were compared with unexposed duplicate specimens. Little change in the appearance of the colours was apparent. With mild diffused daylight\u2014such as that of an ordinary, well-illumined room\u2014the colour remains quite fast and unaltered. Experiments were made on a small scale with oat smut pigment, and the results seemed highly satisfactory. Several grams of the dry spore dust were collected from smutty oats, and it was found that twelve heads of such oats yielded six grams of the brownish-black dust. This powder, being of a dry and light nature, had first to be moistened with a few drops of alcohol, then mixed with gum and water to form a water-colour pigment. In its deepest tones it is of a fine sepia shade, deepening to a brown-black. On diluting with water or Chinese white, pleasing tints of a flat brown, of the pheasant-egg cast, are obtained.

Ceratium and Skeletonema got on very well, the same plants dying off rapidly on being kept in water at rest.","dc.creator":["DARBISHIRE, OTTO V."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["DARBISHIRE, OTTO V."],"citation_author_institution":["Owens College, Manchester"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"On Keeping Marine Organisms Alive in Small...","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;On Keeping Marine Organisms Alive in Small Aquaria&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"059271a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

With snap-locks answering to one master key, and the lockers of each class bearing a label of a distinctive colour, they may be at once opened by the assistant before a class, so that there need be no keys to lose and no depredations on neighbouring lockers.

Physics, again, is often involved in this question of arrangement in a school, since the two subjects may, I think, with little detriment and great economy often have a common lecture room.

The subject is one which has a singular interest tome, for I have been working out the fauna of Italy and its dependent seas, especially in relation to Vertebrata, for the last five and twenty years, and have formed a collection in which about 38,000 specimens (25,000 being fish) represent the vertebrate fauna of Italy and the seas which surround it. I soon found that although strong in Mollusca, Dr. Kobelt was weak in the knowledge of other classes of animals, and that along with solid fact\u201d his book also contains a number of grave inaccuracies. Now I am very busy, and find that life is far too short to allow the waste of time caused by polemics; I usually, therefore, avoid them, and should certainly have passed over Dr. Kobelt's errors and omissions had not your reviewer's remarks in No. 1570 of NATURE (page 99) rendered it imperative that I also should ask you to allow me to make a few remarks.

It may be used for velocities and accelerations as well as mere displacements. As to calculating the distance OC by the formula R2/2L, instead of using the construction of the circular arc, this is a matter of no importance because there is no appreciable difference in the answers.","dc.creator":["PERRY, JOHN"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["PERRY, JOHN"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Valve Motions of Engines","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Valve Motions of Engines&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"062436d0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

He found in the Lob Nor region forests with the trees long dead, traces of a road, ruined villages, coins, manuscripts and other relics which proved the northern shore of the old salt lake (now dry) to have been cultivated and occupied, down to about sixteen centuries ago, by a fairly civilised people. This, I think, implies a rainfall, less inappreciable than the present one, during the earlier centuries of that era, and the change, as he found dead forests, cannot be attributed (as in parts of southern Europe and Syria) to reckless destruction by the hand of man. But, besides this, Sir Norman and Dr. W. J. S. Lockyer have recently proved (in a communication to the Royal Society) a very remarkable correspondence to exist between the distribution of the periodic rains in India, Mauritius and elsewhere and the amount of solar activity, and they have, within the last few days, drawn the attention of the same Society to the fact that zones of abnormally high and low mean barometric pressure exist on opposite sides of the earth and oscillate from the one position to the other in accordance with the periodic small variations of solar activity, Dr. Sven Hedin's discovery apparently indicates a change secular rather than periodic, but may not both operate independently, as in the case of changes due to variations of eccentricity in the earth's orbit and to precession of the axis of rotation? The authors of those papers admit the existence of disturbing causes, some of which may be local, but not necessarily all. Is it, then, possible that these discoveries may afford a clue to the solution of two great geological puzzles\u2014the abnormal temperatures of the Pleistocene and of early Tertiary times? In regard to the former, many now believe that the climate of North Central Europe when the loess was deposited more nearly resembled that of the Caspian steppes, and all maintain that in the Glacial epoch the mean temperature of the whole continent was much below what it is now. How much this, was, at the time of greatest cold, is not easily estimated, but a few years ago I attempted a rough approximation. This will be found in a volume of the Contemporary Science Series called \u201cIce Work\u201d (part iii. chap, i.), and the results (for Europe) are as follows:\u2014Supposing the British Isles to be at their present level (in order to avoid the controversy as to the origin of Boulder-clays and Glacial gravels), the mean temperature of these islands at the present Ordnance Datum would have to be lowered by about 20\u00b0 F. The same would probably hold good of Scandinavia\u2014at any rate, that would suffice to make either country much more closely resemble a corresponding part of Greenland. In the more central parts of Europe, the problem is rather easier, for here we are undoubtedly dealing with \u201cland-ice.\u201d A fall of 18\u00b0 in the mean temperature would suffice for the Alps; perhaps rather less, 15\u00b0 or 16\u00b0, for the Pyrenees, the Sierras Guadarrama and Nevada, possibly also for the breccia-producing age on the Rock of Gibraltar. A reduction of 18\u00b0 at most, and more probably about 16\u00b0 or 15\u00b0, would bring back small glaciers to Auvergne, the Schwarzwald, Vosges, Apennines, Corsican mountains, the Caucasus and even the Atlas. I may add that a reduction of 15\u00b0 appears sufficient to form a great ice-sheet in North America, and that in the southern hemisphere and at Mount Kenya in Africa distinctly smaller change suffices. All these estimates assume the present levels maintained; they may be corrected at the rate of 1\u00b0 for each 300 feet of elevation or depression. But geologists too often forget that the anomaly of early Tertiary heat is not less difficult to explain than that of Pleistocene cold, for in later Eocene ages the mean temperature of southern England can hardly have been less than 20\u00b0 above that which it now enjoys. The explanations which have been offered for the Glacial epoch\u2014a different arrangement of sea and land, variations in eccentricity, precessional movements (none of which, in my opinion, are more than partially successful)\u2014cannot be applied to the latter case, so that we seem compelled to seek for some other cause. Variations in solar heat have been already suggested, but hitherto this hypothesis has seemed too much a Deus ex machin\u00e2. But as Dr. Sven Hedin's discoveries show that important alterations in climate have been in progress during the last fifteen or sixteen centuries, and Sir Norman Lockyer's researches indicate that comparatively small changes in solar activity produce rather important meteorological effects upon the earth, geologists qualified for the investigation may find it not unprofitable to follow up the clue.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"67","prism.number":"1729","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"150","prism.endingPage":"150","prism.copyright":"1902 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/067150a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/067150a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/067150a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/067150a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Secular Changes of Climate","citation_volume":"67","citation_issue":"1729","citation_publication_date":"1902/12","citation_firstpage":"150","citation_lastpage":"150","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/067150a0","DOI":"10.1038/067150a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/067150a0","description":"FOR some time past it has been generally believed that the climate of Central Asia was once less arid than at present, but we now know, as Dr. Sven Hedin explained to the Royal Geographical Society on December 8 (p. 134), that important changes have taken place since the Christian era began.

The animal showed no obvious signs of disease in any organ.

But in the course of a dissection of the heart it was plain that the two series of valves, which lie respectively at the anterior and at the posterior end of the pylangium, were so small, relatively speaking, that, when forced backwards by the pressure of blood in the entire conus arteriosus, they would not meet in the middle line.

The fact is that these valves do not appear to grow pari passu with the general increase in size of the heart and the conus arteriosus.

It might be suggested, therefore, that the imperfection of the circulatory mechanism necessarily caused by the condition of the valves would lead to serious disturbances, and perhaps to death.

If so the animal has a term put to its life by the mere fact that, while the heart grows with the increase in bodily size, the semilunar valves of the conus arteriosus do not.","dc.creator":["BEDDARD, FRANK E."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["BEDDARD, FRANK E."],"citation_author_institution":["Zoological Society's Gardens, London"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Normally Unequal Growth as a Possible Cause of...","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Normally Unequal Growth as a Possible Cause of Death&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"068572b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The coin or other object is placed directly in contact with a photographic plate which is enclosed in an envelope opaque to light. A few milligrams of radium bromide, contained in the usual mica-covered box, are placed some distance above the plate, and the whole left for several days. After development it is found that a clearly defined picture is obtained of the portions in relief on the under sides of the coins.

The coin or other object is placed directly in contact with a photographic plate which is enclosed in an envelope opaque to light. A few milligrams of radium bromide, contained in the usual mica-covered box, are placed some distance above the plate, and the whole left for several days. After development it is found that a clearly defined picture is obtained of the portions in relief on the under sides of the coins. Pictures have thus been obtained of the portions in relief on silver coins (half-crown, sixpence, threepence), also of a name engraved on a mother-of-pearl seal.

It is a disadvantage on my part not to have worked on coral reefs myself, but I have been working for ten years on a coast which is fringed with coral reefs only a short way from where I have seen it, and I have therefore been able to study the base of the reefs without the disguising covering of coral limestone. I have seen beaches crowded with the shells of animals still living in the adjoining sea, raised two and three hundred feet above sea-level, and a short distance away I have seen consolidated sand-dunes going far below sea-level; while from the submerged plateau the edge of which is called the Agulhas Bank, Dr. Gilchrist has dredged large water-worn boulders far out to sea.

It is not only the great size of man's cerebrum as compared with that possessed by anthropoid apes which gives him greater intellectual power, but, as I have stated in the passage quoted by Mr. Mundy from my Hunterian oration, the frontal and parietal lobes of the human brain are \u201cfar more perfectly developed than the corresponding lobes among anthropoid apes.\u201d This is especially the case with respect to those motor and psychical areas of man's cerebral convolutions which control his power of intelligent speech; these areas of the brain are deficient in the anthropoid apes.

No satisfactory explanation of the action was obtained. Experiment showed that it could not be attributed to the abstraction of food or moisture from the soil by the grass, nor to the influence of the grass on the soil temperature or on the gaseous contents of the soil, and subsequent experiments have excluded the formation of acid or alkali from the possible causes.

No satisfactory explanation of the action was obtained. Experiment showed that it could not be attributed to the abstraction of food or moisture from the soil by the grass, nor to the influence of the grass on the soil temperature or on the gaseous contents of the soil, and subsequent experiments have excluded the formation of acid or alkali from the possible causes. The conclusion drawn was that the action was probably that of a poison produced either directly by the grass or indirectly through the agency of bacteria.

A powerful oscillatory discharge is produced in eight or nine coils of wire from two Leyden jars, with a spark-gap of about 2 in. in parallel, connected to a large coil which is run from the main supply. Set in the coils of wire is a glass bulb of about 300 c.c. capacity provided below with a small bulb containing cocoanut charcoal, and connected by a side-tube and tap with a mercury pump.

A powerful oscillatory discharge is produced in eight or nine coils of wire from two Leyden jars, with a spark-gap of about 2 in. in parallel, connected to a large coil which is run from the main supply. Set in the coils of wire is a glass bulb of about 300 c.c. capacity provided below with a small bulb containing cocoanut charcoal, and connected by a side-tube and tap with a mercury pump. After evacuating, heating, and \u201cwashing out,\u201d the bulb with hydrogen, when pure hydrogen is admitted at a fairly low pressure and the discharge is passed, the glow is bluish in colour, and shows both hydrogen and mercury spectra; but if the charcoal bulb be cooled in liquid air so that mercury vapour and any other impurities are completely removed, the glow is of a brilliant rose colour, and shows only hydrogen lines.

It commenced G.M.T. 1.50 a.m. with a sudden increase of H.F., and a corresponding sharp, though slight, movement of the declination needle towards the west. The greatest angular range in declination was 91.5\u00e2 of arc, which occurred at 6 p.m. The spot of light on the recording drum of the H.F. gradually swung downwards with decreasing force, until at 7.35 a.m. it passed beyond the limits of record, and remained off for thirty-seven minutes. It then returned for a moment, when a further sharp decrease took it beyond the limits of record until 11.30 a.m. Then with a succession of oscillations it increased, attaining a maximum of angular displacement of 100 prime; at 4.15 p.m. (1\u00e2=0.44\u201410\u00e25 C.G.S. units). The total range exceeded 130\u00e2. The V.F. also attained its maximum value of increasing force at 4.15 p.m. In all the elements the disturbance was most intense between 4 and 6 p.m., although it did not exhibit any of the very rapid oscillations sometimes characteristic of such movements. A second phase, or repetition of the storm, consisted, as so often happens, of a few isolated well-marked swings in the form of peaks on the photographic records of all the elements. One occurred between 10.30 and 11.25 p.m. on the declination, the magnet swinging east, and the range being 38\u00e2. This was preceded at 11.5 p.m. by an increase of H.F. of 31\u00e2. A second peak was recorded on this element at 1.45 a.m. on June 18, the force decreasing by 11\u00e2.

It then returned for a moment, when a further sharp decrease took it beyond the limits of record until 11.30 a.m. Then with a succession of oscillations it increased, attaining a maximum of angular displacement of 100 prime; at 4.15 p.m. (1\u00e2=0.44\u201410\u00e25 C.G.S. units). The total range exceeded 130\u00e2. The V.F. also attained its maximum value of increasing force at 4.15 p.m. In all the elements the disturbance was most intense between 4 and 6 p.m., although it did not exhibit any of the very rapid oscillations sometimes characteristic of such movements. A second phase, or repetition of the storm, consisted, as so often happens, of a few isolated well-marked swings in the form of peaks on the photographic records of all the elements. One occurred between 10.30 and 11.25 p.m. on the declination, the magnet swinging east, and the range being 38\u00e2. This was preceded at 11.5 p.m. by an increase of H.F. of 31\u00e2. A second peak was recorded on this element at 1.45 a.m. on June 18, the force decreasing by 11\u00e2. A small decrease of V.F. accompanied this movement of the H.F.","dc.creator":["CORTIE, A.

The guns were about 100 yards from the road, on lower ground, and pointing so that the shells just cleared. The battery had been in action all day. There was very little wind and no traffic over the road during day-time. The whole surface of the road in front of the guns was covered by a series of small ripples at right angles to the direction of the guns. The ripples were about 1/12 in. apart, from east to west. They were evidently caused by the explosive wave passing over the road.

A variety of applications for polymer optical nanofibers, including waveguides, light sources and sensors, have been reported in recent years. In this article, the recent progress in the field of polymer optical nanofibers is reviewed in terms of their fabrication, characterization and applications. In particular, we focus on functionalized polymer nanofibers doped with functional materials, such as dye molecules, noble metal nanoparticles, quantum dots and rare earth ions, which greatly expand their capabilities of generating, propagating, converting and modulating light at the nanoscale.

Label-free tomographic phase microscopy is an excellent candidate to perform this task.

We demonstrate that by exploiting the random rolling of cells while they are flowing along a microfluidic channel, it is possible to obtain in-line phase-contrast tomography, if smart strategies for wavefront analysis are adopted. In fact, surprisingly, a priori knowledge of the three-dimensional position and orientation of rotating cells is no longer needed because this information can be completely retrieved through digital holography wavefront numerical analysis. This approach makes continuous-flow cytotomography suitable for practical operation in real-world, single-cell analysis and with a substantial simplification of the optical system; that is, no mechanical scanning or multi-direction probing is required. A demonstration is given for two completely different classes of biosamples: red blood cells and diatom algae.

Tomographic phase microscopy is promising for high-throughput, single-cell analysis, but it is difficult to implement as it requires a complex setup for rotating samples. Now, Pietro Ferraro and co-workers in Italy have performed tomographic phase microscopy of red blood cells and diatoms by exploiting their random rolling motion as they flow along a microfluidic channel.

It is composed of four modules, each tailored for a specific group of individuals based on their language and developmental level. On average, a module takes between 30 and 60\u2009min to deliver. We used a series of machine-learning algorithms to study the complete set of scores from Module 1 of the ADOS available at the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) for 612 individuals with a classification of autism and 15 non-spectrum individuals from both AGRE and the Boston Autism Consortium (AC). Our analysis indicated that 8 of the 29 items contained in Module 1 of the ADOS were sufficient to classify autism with 100% accuracy.

It is composed of four modules, each tailored for a specific group of individuals based on their language and developmental level. On average, a module takes between 30 and 60\u2009min to deliver. We used a series of machine-learning algorithms to study the complete set of scores from Module 1 of the ADOS available at the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) for 612 individuals with a classification of autism and 15 non-spectrum individuals from both AGRE and the Boston Autism Consortium (AC). Our analysis indicated that 8 of the 29 items contained in Module 1 of the ADOS were sufficient to classify autism with 100% accuracy. We further validated the accuracy of this eight-item classifier against complete sets of scores from two independent sources, a collection of 110 individuals with autism from AC and a collection of 336 individuals with autism from the Simons Foundation.
