You will, however, allow me to state that, though this is true of some species, such as Quercus lobata Nee, which was the one I chiefly referred to in the passage quoted, yet that the acorns of others have a decidedly injurious effect, or are inedible. For instance, it is very commonly believed by the rancheros that the acorns of Q. Kellongii Newb. give rise among pigs to a peculiar disease of the kidneys, while the acorns of a new species from Southern Oregon\u2014which I shall shortly describe in a work now in the press\u2014(Q. echinoides mihi) are so very bitter that no animal but the black bear (Ursus Americanus) will eat them, and it only when pressed by hunger. On the other hand the acorns of Quercus Orstediana (mihi), another as yet undescribed species, are so nutritious, that though the species never grows to a greater size than a small shrub, the produce of forty or fifty such bushes will fatten a hog. Again, there is a difference of quality among the edible species. The \u201cdigger\u201d Indian, who is quite a connoisseur in acorns, makes a difference; for while the interior tribes prefer those of Q. lobata, those living near the coast chiefly affect Q. sonomensis Benth. Though pigs fatten freely on the acorns of Quercus Garryana Dougl., and in California on those of its ally, Q. Douglasii Hook., yet I never knew the Indians either in Vancouver Island or in California eat the acorns of either species, while those of Q. agrifolia Nee, Q. chrysolepis Liebm., Q. densiflora Hook. and Arn., Q Sadleriana mihi (nondescript species), &c., are not, so far as I am aware, eaten by any animal but squirrels. The fruit of Castanopsis chrysophylla Doug., a plant allied to the oaks and chestnuts, is, however, in great favour with the black bear. I have eaten the acorns cooked in the manner described in the extract, and\u2014I suppose in common with other naturalists in the less explored parts of North-west America\u2014have been forced by hunger to search for the acorns which el carpentero (Melanerpes torquatus) stores away for its use in the spongy bark of Torreya, Sequoia, Pinus, and various other trees, yet notwithstanding the sauce which famine gave to my appetite, I must confess that they were by no means palatable.

You will, however, allow me to state that, though this is true of some species, such as Quercus lobata Nee, which was the one I chiefly referred to in the passage quoted, yet that the acorns of others have a decidedly injurious effect, or are inedible. For instance, it is very commonly believed by the rancheros that the acorns of Q. Kellongii Newb. give rise among pigs to a peculiar disease of the kidneys, while the acorns of a new species from Southern Oregon\u2014which I shall shortly describe in a work now in the press\u2014(Q. echinoides mihi) are so very bitter that no animal but the black bear (Ursus Americanus) will eat them, and it only when pressed by hunger. On the other hand the acorns of Quercus Orstediana (mihi), another as yet undescribed species, are so nutritious, that though the species never grows to a greater size than a small shrub, the produce of forty or fifty such bushes will fatten a hog. Again, there is a difference of quality among the edible species. The \u201cdigger\u201d Indian, who is quite a connoisseur in acorns, makes a difference; for while the interior tribes prefer those of Q. lobata, those living near the coast chiefly affect Q. sonomensis Benth. Though pigs fatten freely on the acorns of Quercus Garryana Dougl., and in California on those of its ally, Q. Douglasii Hook., yet I never knew the Indians either in Vancouver Island or in California eat the acorns of either species, while those of Q. agrifolia Nee, Q. chrysolepis Liebm., Q. densiflora Hook. and Arn., Q Sadleriana mihi (nondescript species), &c., are not, so far as I am aware, eaten by any animal but squirrels. The fruit of Castanopsis chrysophylla Doug., a plant allied to the oaks and chestnuts, is, however, in great favour with the black bear. I have eaten the acorns cooked in the manner described in the extract, and\u2014I suppose in common with other naturalists in the less explored parts of North-west America\u2014have been forced by hunger to search for the acorns which el carpentero (Melanerpes torquatus) stores away for its use in the spongy bark of Torreya, Sequoia, Pinus, and various other trees, yet notwithstanding the sauce which famine gave to my appetite, I must confess that they were by no means palatable. This may, however, have been prejudice, for the Ancient Britons\u2014who were by no means savages in the ordinary acceptation of the term\u2014ate the acorns of Quercus robur, the common oak of this country. How they cooked them we are not informed. I presume, however, that it was not in so recherch\u00e9 a style as practised by some aboriginal friends of Mr. Paul Kane, the artist\u2014a full description of which those curious in North American Indian cuisine will find in that gentleman's book descriptive of his journey across the American continent.","dc.creator":["BROWN, ROBERT"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["BROWN, ROBERT"],"citation_author_institution":["Edinburgh"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Californian Oaks","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Californian Oaks&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"003348a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The wind was easterly, and the sun shone brightly where I was standing. If any of your numerous correspondents would favour me with an explanation of the above I would be greatly obliged. No other halo or portion of a halo was visible at the time.","dc.creator":["BARRINGTON, R.

I should also trespass too much on your courtesy and on the patience of your readers did I enter into any engthened explanation of the following scheme, in which I have adopted to some extent the nomenclature of Prof. Dickson and Dr. M'Nab, and which I offer for consideration solely on the grounds of expediency and simplicity:\u2014","dc.creator":["MASTERS, MAXWELL T."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["MASTERS, MAXWELL T."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Classification of Fruits","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Classification of Fruits&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"005043b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

J. A. Lawson, at Brancepeth, near Durham, is so perfectly similar to its appearance as drawn and described to me by another observer at Woodburn, at the same hour on the same morning, about twenty-miles north-west from Newcastle, and about thirty miles from Durham, that its unusually bright appearance near Durham may not impossibly correspond with equally favourable views of it obtained by observers at more distant places. The sky, which remained clear during the day, clouded over towards midnight on the 13th, and the stars were completely hidden during the remainder of the night. A slight rain, which began in the morning, also continued to fall during the day of the 14th, and the sky here remained entirely overcast on that evening until after midnight. Shortly before four o'clock on the morning of the 15th the clouds cleared off, and the appearance of several meteors, one of which was as bright as Jupiter, gave evident signs of the progress of the November star-shower. The perfect clearness and darkness of the sky, in the absence of the moon, at the same time gave especial brightness to the meteors and to their phosphorescent streaks. Between four o'clock and the first approach of daylight, at six o'clock, thirty-two meteors were counted, or at the rate of sixteen per hour, of which three were as bright, or brighter, than first magnitude stars, nine as bright as second, six as bright as third, and eight no brighter than stars of the fourth or lesser magnitudes. Twenty-six of these meteors were directed from the usual radiant point in Leo, which on this occasion, although not very well defined, appeared to be approximately close to the star Zeta, in Leo's sickle. About one half of their number left persistent streaks, which sometimes appeared to grow brighter after the meteors had disappeared, and I vainly endeavoured to bring them into the field of view of the direct-viston prisms of a small spectroscope, the duration of the brightest streaks noted scarcely ever exceeding one or two seconds. A very brilliant meteor, casting around a flash like that of lightning, was seen here shortly after nine o'clock on the evening of the 13th (and its appearance was also noted at Woodburn), traversing the north-west sky.

LAUGHTON'S aspect is not only a felicitous word in relation to a plane, but it is susceptible of a wider application than that which he proposes for it, since it expresses a fundamental idea in the theory of surfaces. Every surface has at every point an aspect, which is the direction of a normal at that point. This may be regarded as the first property of surfaces, for if we define a surface as that form of extension which has at every part two and only two dimensions, we virtually say that, among all the directions in space that radiate from any point of the surface, there is one and only one perpendicular to all those (infinite in number) that lie within the surface at that point; in other words, that the surface has a normal at every point. A plane is then a continuous surface which has the same aspect throughout, the angle of two planes is the measure of their difference in respect of aspect; parallel planes (as Mr. Wilson points out) are those which have the same aspect, a plane tangent to a surface is one which contains a point of the surface, and has the aspect of the surface at that point, and a line tangent to a surface is one that contains a point of the surface, and has a direction which lies within the surface (or is perpendicular to the normal) at that point. Then a straight line tangent to a plane lies wholly in the plane, and if such a line, passing through any assumed point of a plane\u2014rotate about that point\u2014always remaining tangent to the plane, it must sweep every point of the plane, for it will generate a continuous and infinite surface coincident throughout its extent with the plane, and the plane, being continuous, can have no points without this surface.

See an article at the end of Bayle's Dictionary, entitled, in the second Rotterdam edition, 1702, \u201cDissertation sur le jour,\u201d vol. iii. p. 3118; in the London edition, 1741, \u201cDissertation concerning the Space of Time called Day,\u201d vol. x. p. 365. The difficulty, as Bayle shows, is in the nature of things. Let an equatorial railroad go round the world in twenty-four hours, with a station at every 45th meridian. At noon of October 20, Mr. West takes \u201ca return ticket\u201d westward; Mr. East takes one eastward. Both reckon by solar time. At every station Mr. West finds it noon, and on his return home reckons noon October 20; but the station-master reckons noon October 21. Mr. East at 45\u00b0 sees the sun set at 6 o'clock. At 90\u00b0 he finds midnight; at 135\u00b0 the sun rises at 6 o'clock on October 21; at 180\u00b0 it is noon. Here the two passengers pass each other, Mr. West reckoning it to be noon of October 20, Mr. East noon of October 21. At 135\u00b0 W., Mr. East sees the sun set) at 90\u00b0 he finds midnight; at 45\u00b0 the sun rises at 6 o'clock on October 22. On his return home Mr. East reckons it to be noon of October 22.

See an article at the end of Bayle's Dictionary, entitled, in the second Rotterdam edition, 1702, \u201cDissertation sur le jour,\u201d vol. iii. p. 3118; in the London edition, 1741, \u201cDissertation concerning the Space of Time called Day,\u201d vol. x. p. 365. The difficulty, as Bayle shows, is in the nature of things. Let an equatorial railroad go round the world in twenty-four hours, with a station at every 45th meridian. At noon of October 20, Mr. West takes \u201ca return ticket\u201d westward; Mr. East takes one eastward. Both reckon by solar time. At every station Mr. West finds it noon, and on his return home reckons noon October 20; but the station-master reckons noon October 21. Mr. East at 45\u00b0 sees the sun set at 6 o'clock. At 90\u00b0 he finds midnight; at 135\u00b0 the sun rises at 6 o'clock on October 21; at 180\u00b0 it is noon. Here the two passengers pass each other, Mr. West reckoning it to be noon of October 20, Mr. East noon of October 21.

The following is the result:\u2014In 1873 my opportunities were exceptionally good for observing the movements of a pair of these birds, inasmuch as the whole season through\u2014from April to November\u2014was spent upon the water, studying our freshwater fishes. My daily record of observations mentions my watching the kingfisher while feeding, from one to tour times a day for eighty-three days\u2014an average of twice a day, or 166 dives for fishes, witnessed; and either every plunge was unsuccessful, or the bird swallowed, before alighting, every fish he had taken. It is to be presumed, of course, that occasionally the bird missed his prey.

I dislike yellow crocuses, and four seasons since planted some hundreds of blue and white in the garden underneath my windows. For two seasons they flowered in beautiful profusion.

There are several references to the apparatus in the Gentleman's Magazine for July, December, 1794, and the next three volumes. At first the word appears in its French form with the final \u201ce,\u201d but the sign of its foreign origin soon disappears.

A dusty drive of two and a half hours, and we were at the door of the inn in the centre of the village. Its appearance was somewhat forlorn, and its fare rather meagre, but the civility of mine host compensated for all other defects. Here we engaged two mules, a porter, and a driver, an operation which took more than two hours, and then set off again for the Casa del Bosco, which we reached in the middle of the afternoon after a ride of two and a quarter hours. A climb up a neighbouring hillock to see the sunset, dinner, and a few hours' rest filled up the time till 11 p.m., when we started off again and rode for about half an hour, till the appearance of snow made it necessary to dismount and continue the remainder of the journey on foot. Our guide was very slow, and on any attempt to force the pace stood still and ejaculated: \u201cFermo, Signore! Piano, Piano!\u201d so that we did not arrive at the Casa Inglese till 5 a.m., and were obliged to content ourselves with seeing the sun rise from here instead of from the top, as we had intended. It did not much matter, as it was a cloudy morning, and the view was very poor, but still it was a disappointment. The Casa Inglese was covered with snow to the eaves of the roof, the observatory buried altogether, the Val del Booe a sea of white. After a short rest we trudged on again; so far it had been good walking up an easy ascent of crisp snow, but now it became a work of difficulty to pick one's way through deep drifts and treacherous-looking holes, which seemed to explain the guide's reluctance to undertake this part of the route by moonlight. Arrived however at the foot of the cone, the snow ceased, and a heavy climb up the frozen side under a biting wind began. Half way up matters were not improved by a severe attack of sickness; but at length the top was reached at 6.20 a.m. There was no distant view; within the crater the steam and smoke kept being blown hither and thither, and cleared off at times sufficiently to show parts of what looked like a bottomless pit. It was a curious and weird sight altogether, and well repaid the fatigues of the journey. During the descent the notes of the cuckoo and some very sweet violets found by chance under the snow reminded us that, notwithstanding the mountain's wintry mantle of white, it was really spring time, and that the morning sun had ushered in the merry month of May, a fact which we had well nigh forgotten but a few hours before, when our fingers were numb with cold and our ears threatened to become a thing of the past.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"22","prism.number":"556","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"171","prism.endingPage":"171","prism.copyright":"1880 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/022171a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/022171a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/022171a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/022171a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Ascent of Etna","citation_volume":"22","citation_issue":"556","citation_publication_date":"1880/06","citation_firstpage":"171","citation_lastpage":"171","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/022171a0","DOI":"10.1038/022171a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/022171a0","description":"IT was a bright sunny sky on the last day of April when we started, with Giuseppe Sedici as guide, from the Grand Hotel at Catania in a carriage and pair bound for Nicoloni, en route to the summit of Etna.

Finding itself in captivity, the wasp dropped its booty and spent some time in trying to find a way of escape. Coming at length to a state of rest, it espied the spider and sprang upon it with tiger-like fierceness. Seizing it and raising itself up to its full height, the wasp brought its posterior under and forward with a quick motion, and gave the spider, two or three thrusts with its sting. Assured that the spider was dead, the wasp proceeded to roll it over and over, rapidly working it up into a globular mass. This done it started to fly away; but, foiled in the attempt, it dropped the spider, which was for some time apparently forgotten.

Meek (\u201cCretaceous Invertebrata\u201d in Hayden's Rep., vol. ix. p. xliv.) says: \u201cThe evidence respecting the exact part of the European Cretaceous series to which the Dakota group belongs is not entirely satisfactory. \u2026 The modern affinities of the numerous leaves of the higher types of dicotyledonous trees found in it, present a strong objection to the adoption of the conclusion that it may belong to a lower horizon than the Upper Greensand of British geologists; while its position directly below beds almost beyond doubt representing the Lower or Gray Chalk, precludes its reference to any higher stratigraphical position. Consequently, we have long regarded it as most probably representing in part, if not the whole, the Upper Greensand. \u2026\u201d As the fossils above mentioned belong to the Museum of Comparative Zoology, I hope to be able to give more detailed information upon these galls and mines.","dc.creator":["HAGEN, H.

Bokhara in the Red Sea, about midway from Aden to Suez, the quarter-master on duty called me, saying he had just seen a new comet, or shooting star, which was still visible many minutes after its first appearance. He said that whilst he was looking out ahead, or in a northerly direction, he suddenly noticed the effect of a bright light shining from astern, and on turning round saw a very bright shooting star still moving from left to right, and slightly downwards, in the south, at an altitude of about 40\u00b0. The star speedily disappeared, but left a bright train of light behind it, which continued so long (from five to ten minutes he gue sed) that he thought I might like to see it. I came on deck a little before a quarter past one by the ship's clock, and found a streak of light which I estimated as 8\u00b0 or 10\u00b0 in length, and rather less than half a degree in width, apparently stationary, midway between Sirius and Canopus, and nearly as bright as the comet, the head of which must have risen half an hour or more previously. I watched the streak till half-past one o'clock, when it seemed sensibly fainter, though still a conspicuous object, notwithstanding the presence of the moon, the comet, and a number of bright stars.

A great number of the still remaining examples have been utilised as gate-posts and rubbing-stones for cattle, i.e. upright stones set up in fields by Welsh farmers for cattle to rub their itching skins against.

The sunrise was \u201cvery fine, but nothing to compare with the sunset of yesterday,\u201d and \u201cthe filmy streaks were very thin, and stretched this morning from south-west by south to north-east by north.\u201d Nevertheless there was the strange bluish-white glare above the eastern horizon, casting shadows, and a thin pink film up to about 75\u00b0 at 28 min. before sunrise.

The sunrise was \u201cvery fine, but nothing to compare with the sunset of yesterday,\u201d and \u201cthe filmy streaks were very thin, and stretched this morning from south-west by south to north-east by north.\u201d Nevertheless there was the strange bluish-white glare above the eastern horizon, casting shadows, and a thin pink film up to about 75\u00b0 at 28 min. before sunrise.

For some time I took it to be an ordinary case of vibration, but it presented so many peculiar features that I was induced to examine it more closely. It frequently happens that when the temperature and dew-point of the air are at or about the freezing-point, and the sky is clear, the wires are chilled by radiation, and hoar-frost is deposited upon them. With an almost imperceptible wind the hoar-frost collects almost wholly upon one side of the wire in the form of a wing, producing a torsional strain. The weight of the hoarfrost, as compared with the weight of line, is so small that their common centre of gravity is almost coincident with the centre of the wire.

For some time I took it to be an ordinary case of vibration, but it presented so many peculiar features that I was induced to examine it more closely. It frequently happens that when the temperature and dew-point of the air are at or about the freezing-point, and the sky is clear, the wires are chilled by radiation, and hoar-frost is deposited upon them. With an almost imperceptible wind the hoar-frost collects almost wholly upon one side of the wire in the form of a wing, producing a torsional strain. The weight of the hoarfrost, as compared with the weight of line, is so small that their common centre of gravity is almost coincident with the centre of the wire. When in this condition, if a light wind acts upon the frozen wing, it imparts a reciprocating rotary motion to the wire. Each time the vibration brings the plane of the protuberance in a line with the eye, the wire almost disappears from sight, while when it is at right angles to that line it flashes suddenly into view. If looked at from such a point that the wing of hoar-frost moves backwards and forwards behind the black wire, the effect is very much more marked.","dc.creator":["DEELEY, R.

To begin: I appeal to those farmers who have somewhat studied the question to make it clear to those who have not done so that each warble lump has a large maggot under it, feeding on the juices of the hide or flesh. These lumps many call \u201chealth lumps\u201d or \u201cthriving bumps,\u201d and seem to prefer that their cattle should have them. It is readily seen how this serious fallacy has arisen, viz. from the fact that the warble lumps begin to show about Christmas (from the growth of the maggot under them), which also happens to be the time that the cattle receive their most nourishing food, and are then warmly housed or sheltered. But there could be no greater mistake than to think that the swellings from the ravages of these horrid maggots are proof of a thriving condition! A correspondent writes me: \u201cSince reading recent issues on the ox-bot or warble-fly, I have visited several cattle markets and slaughter-houses to see for myself if the ravages of the maggots are so serious as the statements led one to believe. I must frankly state that what I have seen convinces me that the statements are much under the mark rather than over it. The first beast I handled showed 42 warbles, some only 3 to 6, whilst many others showed 30 to 70; and on examining hides at slaughter-houses this state of things was again confirmed (the warbles are more readily seen upon the under-side of the skin, and many are small ones that would not show as a lump.

They were transferred from their habitat and placed in a large saucer with peat and Sphagnum, under a bell glass.

They maintain\u2014and I think the position is unassailable\u2014that during the Mammoth period that district which is now a bare tundra, on which neither in summer nor winter could herds of pachyderms find food or shelter, was marked by a temperate climate, and was probably occupied by forests to the very borders of the Arctic Ocean.","dc.creator":["HOWORTH, HENRY H."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["HOWORTH, HENRY H."],"citation_author_institution":["Bentcliffe, Eccles"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Climate of Siberia in the Mammoth Age","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Climate of Siberia in the Mammoth Age&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"039367a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It is out of the question, however, that yesterday there can have been any dew to produce the phenomenon, as there had been a thick hoar frost on the grass, all melted by the warm sun by 10.30 a.m., at which time there was a very vivid double \u201crainbow,\u201d which seemed exactly like an ordinary bow upon rain, except that there were none of the supernumerary arcs due to diffraction, and that the outer bow was fainter than usual in proportion to the inner one. The pond was thinly frozen over, but, it being a cloudless day, the surface of the ice was by that time covered with water. On closely examining the scum, I found it was composed of floating black particles, I presume of soot (the weather being rather foggy), and to many of these, minute drops were adhering, which varied much in size, the largest being probably 1/50 of an inch in diameter. It was surprising to find distinct drops upon water, but I suppose it must have been the particles of soot that kept them separate. It seems probable they were a portion of the melted hoar frost; but it is rather curious that in such a situation this can produce a rainbow, seeing that usually melted hoar frost does not do so at all, or at most gives a very slight one; so decidedly is this the case, that one may distinguish in the morning between dew and melted hoar frost by noticing whether a \u201crainbow\u201d and white anthelion are formed; dew being capable of producing bright ones owing to the roundness of the drops composing it, while hoar frost when it melts usually turns into irregular drops. I may say, however, that this \u201crainbow\u201d on the pond was far more brilliant than any ordinary dew bow, and therefore it would appear that there is some property in the particles of soot to perfect the roundness of drops adhering to them, and so produce a striking phenomenon even from melted hoar frost.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"43","prism.number":"1114","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"416","prism.endingPage":"416","prism.copyright":"1891 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/043416a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/043416a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/043416a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/043416a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Rainbows on Scum","citation_volume":"43","citation_issue":"1114","citation_publication_date":"1891/03","citation_firstpage":"416","citation_lastpage":"416","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/043416a0","DOI":"10.1038/043416a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/043416a0","description":"I HAVE several times noticed \u201crainbows\u201d on the black scum upon the pond in a park in this town, and have imagined all of them to have been formed on dew deposited upon a film of soot.

Frederick Wright. The theory of deep interglacial submergence which has been propounded to account for the shell-beds at Moel Tryfaen, near Snowdon, and at Macclesfield, is opposed by several formidable objections, viz. (1) the subsidence must have been one which affected North Wales and central England without affecting the region south of the the Thames and Bristol Channel; (2) there is in other places a considerable absence of marks of subsidence over the northern part of the centre of England, where it is supposed to have been the greatest; (3) the Pennine Chain is not more than 25 or 30 miles wide from east to west, yet east of Macclesfield there is an entire absence upon its flanks both of glacial deposits and of beach lines; (4) the shell beds are strictly confined not only to the area which was demonstrably covered by glacial ice, but to those more limited areas which were reached by ice that is known to have moved in its way over shallow sea-bottoms; (5) the assemblage of shells is not such as could have occurred in one place in the ordinary course of nature. The author develops a system of glaciers which will explain the facts at present known, upon the supposition of a single glacial epoch.\u2014The Permian of Texas, by Ralph S. Tarr.

At 9h. 6m. p.m., according to Marth's ephemeris, two satellites, Enceladus and Tethys, were in conjunction with the east end of the ring. They were going in apparently opposite directions, Tethys away from Saturn. Their conjunctions with the middle of the Cassini division would, I find, take place at 8h. 36m. p.m. for Tethys, and at 9h. 36m. p.m. for Enceladus. Both satellites would be so close to the ring as to appear inseparable from it. Tethys, moving in an orbit inclined as much as 65\u2032 to the plane of the rings, might easily be half superposed in appearance upon the northern boundary of the rings.

Reference is made therein to the discovery of a \u201cnew type of marsupial\u201d by Dr. Stirling. The animal in question was found by Mr. South, a mounted trooper (or rather by his cat, who brought it into the house), at Alice Springs. By him it was presented on our arrival to Dr. Stirling, who had charge of the anthropological work of the expedition, by whom it was kindly handed on to me as officer in charge of the zoological department. The specimen was a male, and being desirous of securing more, I stayed behind the party, and by aid of the blacks procured two more specimens, both of them females. The animal, which lives in holes amongst the rocks and stones is by no means common, as I had to offer considerable quantities of flour and tobacco to the blacks as a reward for its capture. After a number of them had been out hunting for several days the total result was two more specimens, though as these were females they formed a welcome addition to my zoological collections.

Reference is made therein to the discovery of a \u201cnew type of marsupial\u201d by Dr. Stirling. The animal in question was found by Mr. South, a mounted trooper (or rather by his cat, who brought it into the house), at Alice Springs. By him it was presented on our arrival to Dr. Stirling, who had charge of the anthropological work of the expedition, by whom it was kindly handed on to me as officer in charge of the zoological department. The specimen was a male, and being desirous of securing more, I stayed behind the party, and by aid of the blacks procured two more specimens, both of them females. The animal, which lives in holes amongst the rocks and stones is by no means common, as I had to offer considerable quantities of flour and tobacco to the blacks as a reward for its capture. After a number of them had been out hunting for several days the total result was two more specimens, though as these were females they formed a welcome addition to my zoological collections. As the expression, \u201ca new type of marsupial,\u201d gives rise to too great expectations, it may be as well to state that it is merely a new species of the genus Phascologale, distinguished, amongst other points, by its remarkably fat tail and by the nature of the striated pads on the soles of its feet.

Make a radial cut in each of the discs, and after interlocking them as in the well-known colour discs, place them on the top. We thus obtain a top in which the lines are spiral, and the relative sizes of black and of white areas are easily regulated by turning one disc to right or left, while the other is held still. If the lines be not too thin or too thick, and not too near together, and if the relative areas of black and white be adjusted suitably to the light, the top exhibits, when spun, broad bands of colour, each band containing all the colours of the spectrum in their natural order. The spaces between the lines should be not less than five times as broad as the lines themselves. The brightest effects are produced in my own case, by lamplight, with the areas of light and dark almost equal; by daylight, with the dark area about three times as great as the light. Other proportions, however, seem to give better results with other people.","dc.creator":["HURST, C.

RILEY, M.A., Ph.D., whose death on the 14th ult., in consequence of injuries received in a fall from a bicycle in the streets of Washington, was announced in these columns on October 3, was an Englishman, born at Walton-on-Thames in 1843. He emigrated to the United States at the age of seventeen, and settled, as we learn from the Garden and Forest, on a farm in Illinois. Like so many other Americans, who have since made a reputation in science, he served as a soldier in the civil war. Subsequently, after some experience as a journalist, he was appointed State Entomologist of Missouri, a position he occupied nearly ten years. During this period he did excellent work in the investigation of the life-histories of insects injurious to plants, and experiments to discover the most effectual means of destroying them. But one of his earliest papers was on a new genus (Pronubia) of the Tineid\u00e6, and the part it plays in the fertilisation of Yucca.1 This was an important and interesting contribution to biological science. In 1878 he accepted the post of Entomologist to the United States Department of Agriculture at Washington, where, in the words of the authority cited above, he practically supervised all the entomological work of the Government until his resignation last year.

RILEY, M.A., Ph.D., whose death on the 14th ult., in consequence of injuries received in a fall from a bicycle in the streets of Washington, was announced in these columns on October 3, was an Englishman, born at Walton-on-Thames in 1843. He emigrated to the United States at the age of seventeen, and settled, as we learn from the Garden and Forest, on a farm in Illinois. Like so many other Americans, who have since made a reputation in science, he served as a soldier in the civil war. Subsequently, after some experience as a journalist, he was appointed State Entomologist of Missouri, a position he occupied nearly ten years. During this period he did excellent work in the investigation of the life-histories of insects injurious to plants, and experiments to discover the most effectual means of destroying them. But one of his earliest papers was on a new genus (Pronubia) of the Tineid\u00e6, and the part it plays in the fertilisation of Yucca.1 This was an important and interesting contribution to biological science. In 1878 he accepted the post of Entomologist to the United States Department of Agriculture at Washington, where, in the words of the authority cited above, he practically supervised all the entomological work of the Government until his resignation last year. The valuable results of the investigations and experiments conducted by him and his staff, were in part published in occasional bulletins, of which thirty-two appeared between 1883 and 1894, and partly in the now familiar periodical entitled Insect Life, which was established in 1888. Six volumes appeared under his editorship. Dr. Riley was an in-defatigable worker, and his organising and administrative abilities were well exemplified in the department which he so successfully developed.","dc.creator":["H., W.

This, however, in no way affects the suggestion. In the next place, I must part company from Mr. Bather on a point of fundamental principle. I decline to accept, as a canon of scientific method, that a zoological (why particularly \u201czoological\u201d?) hypothesis put forward in explanation of a body of facts still under investigation, and, possibly, leading us on to new principles, should, in order to become plausible, \u201cbe proved consonant with some known fact.\u201d I take it that, in making tentative suggestions for the interpretation of results obtained by observation, as in the case under consideration, it is sufficient, if the hypothesis is not opposed by any known fact. I did not lay it down as a dogma that selection must have acted in the way stated. In fact, Prof. Weldon's original interpretation has not yet been, and never may, be disproved, and, for all we know to the contrary, selection may still be acting in the direction indicated by his measurements. Mr. Bather will see, on reference to my letter, that I advanced the idea \u201cfor whatever that idea may be worth.\u201d It appears necessary to point out that the \u201cfacts\u201d are before us in this case; it is a question of interpretation. The difficulty raised by your correspondent is one of his own creation, and not one of mine. Where have I stated, or even suggested, that the appearance of a character which formerly was of selection value, and which now appears in the later stage of individual development, is a \u201cuniversal principle\u201d? If the suggestion which I made with reference to the interpretation of Prof. Weldon's results is sound in principle, it is obvious that it refers to a (comparatively) recent cessation of selection, and so far Mr. Bather has correctly grasped my meaning. When, however, he lays it down, on his own responsibility, that the conditions then \u201ccan hardly have been very different to now,\u201d he is laying claim to a knowledge of the past and present conditions of life and to a familiarity with the time necessary to bring about the modification of species, at which I can only stand aside with envy and admiration. If Mr. Bather really must have some \u201cknown fact\u201d after this distinct dissociation of myself from his methods, I will refer him to those cases of mimetic butterflies which have no models. There is good reason for believing that certain butterflies which are undoubted mimics, since they depart from their allies in type of pattern, have for some unknown reason survived, while the species which they imitated have, also for unknown reasons, become extinct. The mimics still retain their mimetic pattern and colouring, but the selective process which produced this type can no longer (in the absence of the model) be regarded as in active operation. Nevertheless, the mimetic disguise is retained by virtue of heredity, and appears in the last stage of the ontogeny. Your correspondent will, I hope, pardon any apparent discourtesy if I state that the correspondence on this subject is, so far as I am concerned, now closed. I can assure him that he shall hear more about the results of Prof. Weldon's measurements at no very distant future.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"55","prism.number":"1411","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"29","prism.endingPage":"30","prism.copyright":"1896 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/055029c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/055029c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/055029c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/055029c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Inheritance of Specific Characters","citation_volume":"55","citation_issue":"1411","citation_publication_date":"1896/11","citation_firstpage":"29","citation_lastpage":"30","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/055029c0","DOI":"10.1038/055029c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/055029c0","description":"IN the first place, I will take the opportunity afforded me by Mr. Bather, of correcting a slip in my letter; it is narrowness of carapace that is being, or has been, selected, and not breadth, as I stated. This, however, in no way affects the suggestion. In the next place, I must part company from Mr. Bather on a point of fundamental principle. I decline to accept, as a canon of scientific method, that a zoological (why particularly \u201czoological\u201d?) hypothesis put forward in explanation of a body of facts still under investigation, and, possibly, leading us on to new principles, should, in order to become plausible, \u201cbe proved consonant with some known fact.\u201d I take it that, in making tentative suggestions for the interpretation of results obtained by observation, as in the case under consideration, it is sufficient, if the hypothesis is not opposed by any known fact. I did not lay it down as a dogma that selection must have acted in the way stated. In fact, Prof. Weldon's original interpretation has not yet been, and never may, be disproved, and, for all we know to the contrary, selection may still be acting in the direction indicated by his measurements. Mr. Bather will see, on reference to my letter, that I advanced the idea \u201cfor whatever that idea may be worth.\u201d It appears necessary to point out that the \u201cfacts\u201d are before us in this case; it is a question of interpretation.

It results usually in the resignation of the most original and brilliant characters who may have sufficient private means to secure a bare independence; while the others remain quite at the mercy of their governing body, who may at any moment\u2014even without any assigned motive\u2014give them notice to resign. This and the very inadequate salaries attached result in constant changes in he staff. Further, the fever of competition induces the different university colleges to take up technical and pedagogical training, adding department after department at a rate greatly in advance of their means, so that no side can be worked to its full development owing to an insufficient staff and an over-burdened exchequer.","dc.creator":["VERITAS"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["VERITAS"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Duties of Provincial Professors","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Duties of Provincial Professors&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"060390a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

But we have now more definite grounds for feeling sure of its ultimate success, and we can predict for it a useful future with much more surety and reason than was done in the first outburst of enthusiasm that followed Mr. Marconi's experiments.","dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["NATURE, 1901, vol. lxiii. pp. 403 and 474.","The Electrician, March 22, 1901, vol. xlvi. p. 819.","Journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, 1901, vol. xxx. p. 73.","See the Electician, August 1893, p. 439."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Recent Developments in Electric Signalling","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;Emphasis Type=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Recent Developments in...","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"064102a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

There is also an island with large trees and a dense undergrowth.","dc.creator":["ORIENTALIS, PLATANUS"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["ORIENTALIS, PLATANUS"],"citation_author_institution":["Aston Rowant, Oxon"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Weather Changes and the Appearance of Scum on...","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Weather Changes and the Appearance of Scum on Ponds&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"069029c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The season was very wet as the potatoes were maturing; in fact, the ground was too soft to allow of digging at the proper time. My explanation is that the great quantity of water on the ground destroyed the balance between producing power in the leaves and storage power in the normal tubers, and that the surplus production deposited itself in the stems, which at the selected spots became modified tubers.","dc.creator":["TRAYLEN, W."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["TRAYLEN, W."],"citation_author_institution":["Guildford"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"A\u1ebdrial Tubers on the Potato","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;A&#7869;rial Tubers on the Potato&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"070006a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Particulars of the eclipse are given by Mr. Maguire in the Notices of the Astronomical Society, vols. xlv., 400, and xlvi., 26. The sun rose totally eclipsed in 73\u00b0 N. and 42\u00b0 8\u2032 W. at about 9.53 local time, and the central line of the eclipse, after passing near Dublin, Aberystwith, Dover and Fulda, went off the earth at sunset, about 130 miles south of Moscow at 4.20 local time; St. David's, Winchester and London were within the limits of totality. With regard to the hour of the eclipse, it is needful to consider not only mean time and apparent time, but also natural time, which was the kind of time then in use, according to which the period between sunrise and sunset was conceived to be divided into twelve hours, which were, of course, much shorter in winter than in summer. As the sun rose at London on the day of the eclipse about 7.20, the natural hour would have contained only about 47 minutes of mean time. Mr. Maguire gives the middle of the eclipse at St. David's about 1.12, and at London about 1.18 mean time, and subtracting the equation of time, about 15 minutes, we have 12.57 and 1.3 for the apparent time as shown by a sundial; correcting for natural time, We obtain 1.13 for St. David's and 1.20 for London. Finally, making allowance for the difference of longitude, we see that totality occurred at St. David's at 12.46, and at London at 1.20, according to local time as shown by a waterclock, or some other time-keeper, properly regulated to mark the natural hours. We now have to consider what Asser meant by Nonam and Vesperam. Those who have written about the passage have taken Nonam to be identical with Nonam Horam, but probably they have not been right in doing so. It is shown in the \u201cDictionary of Christian Antiquities\u201d (i. 793) that the day and night were divided into four equal parts, and that each quarter of the day was named after the last hour in it. \u201cNone embraces the seventh, eighth and ninth hours; and the last called Duodecima contains the tenth, eleventh and twelfth, ending at Sunset.\u201d Asser, however, evidently uses Vespera for Duodecima. Nona is, in fact, noon, the point when the sun is on the meridian, the beginning of the seventh hour, and Vespera is the point half-way between noon and sunset, in this case 2.20 mean time and 3.0 natural time. Thus what Asser says is this, that the eclipse was total at a point of time between noon and 1.30 natural time, and we see that the statement is true for any point in England or Wales. If we could be sure that the sentence about the hour of the eclipse was written by Asser of St. David's, it would be a very strong argument, indeed, for the genuineness of the book which is called by his name, for it fixes the moment of the eclipse correctly to within seventy minutes of mean time for any place at which it is possible that the book could have been written.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"70","prism.number":"1801","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"6","prism.endingPage":"6","prism.copyright":"1904 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/070006a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/070006a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/070006a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/070006a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Asser and the Solar Eclipse of October 29, 878","citation_volume":"70","citation_issue":"1801","citation_publication_date":"1904/05","citation_firstpage":"6","citation_lastpage":"6","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/070006a0","DOI":"10.1038/070006a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/070006a0","description":"UNDER the date DCCCLXXIX, Asser, in his \u201cLife of King Alfred,\u201d gives the following entry:\u2014\u201cEodem anno eclipsis solis inter nonam et vesperam, sed proprius ad nonam, facta est.\u201d The oldest manuscript of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle also notes an eclipse in 879, but it cannot be doubted that in each case the reference is to the eclipse of October 29, 878, which was total in South Wales and southern England.

This differs from the two absolute systems previously discussed in that W/g is not here a measure of mass, on account of the variable nature of the gravitational unit of force, as his weight and mass are numerically the same, while g varies with locality. A concrete example well illustrates this system. Suppose a body weighing 32.182 pounds at London to leave the earth under the action of an upward resultant force of one pound, and to travel through space with an acceleration of one foot per second per second.

This differs from the two absolute systems previously discussed in that W/g is not here a measure of mass, on account of the variable nature of the gravitational unit of force, as his weight and mass are numerically the same, while g varies with locality. A concrete example well illustrates this system. Suppose a body weighing 32.182 pounds at London to leave the earth under the action of an upward resultant force of one pound, and to travel through space with an acceleration of one foot per second per second. The value of g would continually decrease, but the weight (i.e. the gravitational force between the earth and the body) would in this system always be called 32.182 pounds, so that at the instant when g was reduced, say, 50 per cent., the acceleration force, though unchanged in amount, would be called two pounds, in order that Prof. Bryan's proportion should still be true.

John Griffith (May 2, p. 9) it would at first sight appear that the modern \u201cDruids\u201d had indeed preserved a tradition of the May year as well as of the solstitial year in connection with the circles set up by them for the performance of their ceremonies. I should be glad to think that this was the case, but I find considerable difficulty in connecting the modern circles with the ancient ones; there is no ancient circle which shows any sign of ever having possessed such an array of outlying stones as appears in the plan given by Mr. Griffith, and the outlying stones that remain do not always conform to it either; nor is there any ancient circle, except those in which a sepulchral cist forms the central point, and Stonehenge, which has a flat stone in the centre. The late \u201cMyfyr Morganwg, Archdruid of Wales,\u201d set up a circle round the rocking stone at Pontypridd in the middle of the last century, but in place of the eight outlying stones figured by Mr. Griffith it has curved avenues forming the head and tail ends of a serpent, so it does not appear that modern \u201cDruidic\u201d authorities are agreed upon this important subject. \u201cMyfyr Morganwg\u201d also published a book in Welsh, the principal illustration to which represents a Druid standing on a flat stone (sometimes it is a three-legged dolmen), surrounded by a circle of twelve others, on which converge three rays of light coming from the north-east, east, and south-east, and forming, no doubt, the original model of the \u201cbroad arrow\u201d and of the \u201cY cross,\u201d but without any outlying stones, though three smaller stones are represented in those lines inside the circle; three stones which may represent these, or may, with others there, be intended for an inner circle, also exist in his Pontypridd circle. The central stone for sitting or standing on seems to be a sine qu\u00e2 non with the modern \u201cDruids,\u201d but it is not found in ancient circles. There are upright stones in the middle of the circles at Callernish, Boscawen-un, the Stripple Stones, and the Marshpool or Hoar-stone circle (Shropshire), and there was one in the middle of the southern inner circles at Avebury, where also the middle of the northern inner circles was occupied by a \u201ccove,\u201d or open shrine of three stones, as again was the case at Arborlow, but at none of these places, except perhaps in the Shropshire circle, could any man stand or sit on these stones, though he might stand in front of them. In the other great British circles (Stonehenge, which occupies a place by itself amongst them, excepted) there is nothing in the centre nor any appearance of there ever having been anything, although there is reason to believe that whatever was done in them was done at or about the centre.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"76","prism.number":"1962","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"127","prism.endingPage":"127","prism.copyright":"1907 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/076127a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/076127a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/076127a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/076127a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Astronomical and Arch\u00e6ological Value of the Welsh Gorsedd","citation_volume":"76","citation_issue":"1962","citation_publication_date":"1907/06","citation_firstpage":"127","citation_lastpage":"127","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/076127a0","DOI":"10.1038/076127a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/076127a0","description":"FROM the very interesting communication of the Rev.

But our supplies of brilliant green have hitherto been derived from Germany, and I shall be indebted to your readers for information as to whether this dye is prepared in a fairly pure state by anyone in this country.","dc.creator":["BROWNING, C.

Yet even their pages figure grey-copper veins of Los Arcos cutting Tertiary beside ophite and granite intrusions.

An alteration in the rate of relocation of organic carbon from the continents to the oceans cannot therefore be predicted on the basis of temperature change alone.","dc.creator":["Tranvik, L.

These results demonstrate the central role of Rac GTPases in multiple aspects of axon development in vivo, and suggest that axon growth, guidance and branching could be controlled by differential activation of Rac signalling pathways.","dc.creator":["Ng, Julian","Nardine, Timothy","Harms, Matthew","Tzu, Julia","Goldstein, Ann","Sun, Yan","Dietzl, Georg","Dickson, Barry J.","Luo, Liqun"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Science; citation_title=Rho GTPases and the actin cytoskeleton; citation_author=A Hall; citation_volume=279; citation_publication_date=1998; citation_pages=509-514; citation_doi=10.1126/science.279.5350.509; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Genes Dev.; citation_title=Distinct morphogenetic functions of similar small GTPases: Drosophila Drac1 is involved in axonal outgrowth and myoblast fusion; citation_author=L Luo, YJ Liao, LY Jan, YN Jan; citation_volume=8; citation_publication_date=1994; citation_pages=1787-1802; citation_doi=10.1101/gad.8.15.1787; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Mol.

A gravitational resonance based on the vertical motion of the nearby neptunian moon Galatea was proposed1,2 to explain the trapping of the ring particles into a sequence of arcs.

Palaeontological1,2, morphological3 and molecular studies4,5,6,7 suggest that the order Cetacea (whales, dolphins and porpoises) is more closely related to the order Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates, including cows, camels and pigs) than to other ungulate orders. The traditional view that the order Artiodactyla is monophyletic has been challenged by molecular analyses of variations in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA5,6,7. We have characterized two families of short interspersed elements (SINEs) that were present exclusively in the genomes of whales, ruminants and hippopotamuses, but not in those of camels and pigs.

Palaeontological1,2, morphological3 and molecular studies4,5,6,7 suggest that the order Cetacea (whales, dolphins and porpoises) is more closely related to the order Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates, including cows, camels and pigs) than to other ungulate orders. The traditional view that the order Artiodactyla is monophyletic has been challenged by molecular analyses of variations in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA5,6,7. We have characterized two families of short interspersed elements (SINEs) that were present exclusively in the genomes of whales, ruminants and hippopotamuses, but not in those of camels and pigs. We made an extensive survey of retropositional events that might have occurred during the divergence of whales and even-toed ungulates.

The inflammasomes harboring the NLR members NALP1, NALP3 and IPAF have been best characterized. While the IPAF inflammasome is activated by bacterial flagellin, activation of the NALP3 inflammasome is triggered not only by several microbial components, but also by a plethora of danger-associated host molecules such as uric acid. How NALP3 senses these chemically unrelated activators is not known. Here, we provide evidence that activation of NALP3, but not of the IPAF inflammasome, is blocked by inhibiting K+ efflux from cells. Low intracellular K+ is also a requirement for NALP1 inflammasome activation by lethal toxin of Bacillus anthracis. In vitro, NALP inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 recruitment occurs spontaneously at K+ concentrations below 90\u2009mM, but is prevented at higher concentrations. Thus, low intracellular K+ may be the least common trigger of NALP-inflammasome activation.","prism.publicationName":"Cell Death & Differentiation","prism.publicationDate":"2007-06-29","prism.volume":"14","prism.number":"9","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"1583","prism.endingPage":"1589","prism.copyright":"2007 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/4402195","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/sj.cdd.4402195","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/4402195.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/4402195","citation_journal_title":"Cell Death & Differentiation","citation_journal_abbrev":"Cell Death Differ","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-5403","citation_title":"Activation of the NALP3 inflammasome is triggered by low intracellular potassium concentration","citation_volume":"14","citation_issue":"9","citation_publication_date":"2007/09","citation_online_date":"2007/06/29","citation_firstpage":"1583","citation_lastpage":"1589","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/sj.cdd.4402195","DOI":"10.1038/sj.cdd.4402195","citation_doi":"10.1038/sj.cdd.4402195","description":"Inflammasomes are Nod-like receptor(NLR)- and caspase-1-containing cytoplasmic multiprotein complexes, which upon their assembly, process and activate the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18. The inflammasomes harboring the NLR members NALP1, NALP3 and IPAF have been best characterized. While the IPAF inflammasome is activated by bacterial flagellin, activation of the NALP3 inflammasome is triggered not only by several microbial components, but also by a plethora of danger-associated host molecules such as uric acid. How NALP3 senses these chemically unrelated activators is not known. Here, we provide evidence that activation of NALP3, but not of the IPAF inflammasome, is blocked by inhibiting K+ efflux from cells. Low intracellular K+ is also a requirement for NALP1 inflammasome activation by lethal toxin of Bacillus anthracis. In vitro, NALP inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 recruitment occurs spontaneously at K+ concentrations below 90\u2009mM, but is prevented at higher concentrations. Thus, low intracellular K+ may be the least common trigger of NALP-inflammasome activation.","dc.creator":["P\u00e9trilli, V","Papin, S","Dostert, C","Mayor, A","Martinon, F","Tschopp, J"],"dc.subject":["Life Sciences, general","Biochemistry, general","Cell Biology","Stem Cells","Apoptosis","Cell Cycle Analysis"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Curr Opin Immunol; citation_title=New insights into the mechanism of IL-1beta maturation; citation_author=K Burns, F Martinon, J Tschopp; citation_volume=15; citation_publication_date=2003; citation_pages=26-30; citation_doi=10.1016/S0952-7915(02)00017-1; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Cell; citation_title=Inflammatory caspases: linking an intracellular innate immune system to autoinflammatory diseases; citation_author=F Martinon, J Tschopp; citation_volume=117; citation_publication_date=2004; citation_pages=561-574; citation_doi=10.1016/j.cell.2004.05.004; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Trends Immunol; citation_title=NLRs join TLRs as innate sensors of pathogens; citation_author=F Martinon, J Tschopp; citation_volume=26; citation_publication_date=2005; citation_pages=447-454; citation_doi=10.1016/j.it.2005.06.004; citation_id=CR3","citation_journal_title=Mol Cell; citation_title=The inflammasome.

Indeed it has been the practice to assume that the particulate nature of interstellar dust is manifested only by the way in which such dust scatters and extinguishes light.

Indeed it has been the practice to assume that the particulate nature of interstellar dust is manifested only by the way in which such dust scatters and extinguishes light. Detailed considerations of the properties of interstellar grains as small particles lead, however, to the observation that grains cannot be considered in many instances to behave simply as sub-volumes of a macroscopic solid.
