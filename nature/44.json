I shall content myself, however, with calling attention to what I am now persuaded is the nature of that impression. \u201cSweet are the uses of adversity.\u201d An attack of hemiopsia is always serious, and may be dangerous (see NATURE, Feb. 24th, 1870; p. 444). I think I owe to it the discovery (for such it was to me), that the variable standard of angular magnitude which infects our visual judgment, can be detected in a small room as certainly as in view of the celestial vault. The distressing affection which succeeds the hemiopsia, as soon as it forms a broken arch around the central hole of the retina, is an instructive spectre in regard to the question I am considering. Being referred to two equally distant sites on the wall of the room, one horizontal and the other considerably elevated, the spectre seems larger in the former than in the latter. I soon proved that this was no accident case. I extemporised a very rough experiment on this wise\u2014I placed a disc 14\u00bc inches in diameter on the wall 7 feet from the ground, and selected a horizon so that the base of the disc and the horizon were equidistant from a fixed point of observation. I found the disc was about 30\u00b0 above the horizon. I now took six persons successively, and made each person take an observation from that point, first looking at the disc, and then transferring it in mind to the horizon, where I carefully marked the estimated size. The maximum was 13\n                  \n                    \n                  \n                , the minimum 10\n                  \n                    \n                  \n                , and the mean 12\u00bd inches. This result is, of course, equivalent to saying that had an equal-sized disc been placed on the horizon, its diameter would, taking the average, have appeared to be 1\u00be inch greater than when elevated 30\u00b0 above it. I think it is worth while making this experiment with greater accuracy, and with a greater number of persons. I have no doubt Mr. Abbott's view of the case would be fully borne out. But I do not understand why the augmentation on the horizon is so much greater in the case of the moon and the sun; nor yet why the rising sun does not present so striking an augmentation as the rising moon. The augmentation of the latter may be partly an effect of external conditions; but the fact of augmentation, in what I have called visual judgment, is a question for the physiologist. I should much like to know what, for instance, such an authority as Helmholtz has to say on the matter.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"2","prism.number":"28","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"27","prism.endingPage":"28","prism.copyright":"1870 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/002027a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/002027a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/002027a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/002027a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Apparent Size of the Moon","citation_volume":"2","citation_issue":"28","citation_publication_date":"1870/05","citation_firstpage":"27","citation_lastpage":"28","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/002027a0","DOI":"10.1038/002027a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/002027a0","description":"MY original intention was to put together several ver\u00e6 caus\u00e6, which might be found, concurrently, to contribute to the universal impression that the moon's disc is larger or smaller, according as it is nearer to the horizon, or to the meridian.

At 9h. 45m., when I first noticed it, broad cirrus-like brushes of white light stretched in parallel bands across the zenith, from below Corona in the north-east, across Cor Caroli, nearly overhead, to about the altitude, and 15\u00b0 or 20\u00b0 south of Venus, then shining dimly through clouds in the western sky. My view of the aurora was afterwards confined to an east window; but from a short examination of a clear part of the sky towards south-west, it appeared to be almost as bright, at first, in the opposite direction as in the quarter between north and east, where I had, from that time onwards, an uninterrupted view of its progress. The streamers were white, and irregular in form, rising from no distinct arch, or definite base in any quarter, but they occasionally met and formed a bright corona overhead. A rose-tint pervaded some of them, in the north-east, at 10h. 30m., and presented itself in different parts of the sky until about 11h., when the phenomenon faded, and a faint glow only remained visible in the north. At about 11h. 4Om., while streamers reappeared, forming a bright corona overhead, whose arcs and beams appeared to grow more densely luminous until 12h. 15m. It then showed a well-defined central nucleus, with rays of great brightness proceeding from it, about three-sevenths of the distance from \u03b7 Urs\u00e6 Majoris to Arcturus, white streamers rising to meet it all round, with the appearance of a cupola or dome. While I watched some of the brighter stars through its dense light-cloud, it rapidly assumed a vivid fiery red colour, and a similar bright appearance breaking out at the same moment at the base of a north-east streamer, the fiery glow reflected among the clouds in that direction perfectly resembled a distant conflagration. A wide expanse of brilliant orange and crimson-red light soon joined these two regions of greatest intensity together in one splendid blaze of ruddy colours. This brilliant outburst faded away at 12h. 25m., the streamers disappearing, until 12h. 4Om., when they again met overhead, and formed a corona with a sharply-defined nucleus, about 3\u00b0 west of the star \u03b3 B\u00f6otis. The light of the white streamers flickered considerably, as if waves of varying brightness were driven rapidly over the whole phenomenon by the wind. Until after two O'clock, when the moon rose, and their light was weakened although not extinguished, a constant succession of bright steamers occupied the north-east sky between the horizon and the zenith; towards these I directed the slit of a Browning's Student's Spectroscope, in order to determine, if possible, the position of some of the auroral lines. A single greenish line only was so faintly visible in the spectroscope that all attempts to view it simultaneously with the cross-wires of the instrument proved unsuccessful. A simple form of pointer, substituted for the use of the wires in the dark field of the telescope enabled me, however, to identify its position with considerable accuracy.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"3","prism.number":"77","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"486","prism.endingPage":"486","prism.copyright":"1871 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003486a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/003486a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003486a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003486a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Aurora Borealis","citation_volume":"3","citation_issue":"77","citation_publication_date":"1871/04","citation_firstpage":"486","citation_lastpage":"486","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/003486a0","DOI":"10.1038/003486a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/003486a0","description":"A VERY bright display of aurora was visible here last night, illuminating the greater part of the heavens at intervals with a fitful light.

DARWIN in his recent work on the \u201cDescent of Man has shown that throughout the animal kingdom the male generally displays the stronger passions and is always the most eager. The males, moreover, whenever secondary sexual characters occur, are, as a rule, the possessors of weapons for defence or offence, brilliant colours, or other ornamental appendages, all of which Mr. Darwin supposes to have been acquired through sexual selection, either for the purpose of charming the female or for struggling with other males for the possession of the females. In a few exceptional cases among birds, the females are the wooers, and these are then more brilliantly coloured than the males. In Westwood's work on insects* I met with the following passage:\u2014\u201cM. Donzel has published a curious memoir upon the flight of butterflies whilst coupling (Ann. Soc. Ent. de France, 1837, P. 77.) showing that whilst the males of Pontia Brassic\u00e6, &c., Colias, and Polyommatus support the females, it is the latter which support their partners in the genera Thais, Thecla, Argynnis, Melit\u00e6a, Hipparchia, and Pieris.\u201d Now this is strictly analogous to these exceptional birds, because, among our British representatives of these genera whenever a considerable sexual difference of colour occurs, the female is always the more brilliantly coloured. Thus, the female Thecla Quercus has the bright purple patch, and the female Thecla Betul\u00e6 the brilliant orange blotch on the fore wing, while the females of Hipparchia (Satyrus), Janira, and H. Semele are considerably brighter than their partners. The female H. Meg\u00e6ra is rather brighter than the male, and the same is true of Colias Edusa and C. Hyale, since the females of these species have orange or yellow spots in the black marginal border, represented in the males by thin streaks only. The females of the whole genus Pieris also are ornamented with black spots on the fore wings, which are only partially present in the males. I must confess that I am not convinced of the action of sexual selection in producing the colours of insects, but it cannot be denied that these facts are strikingly corroborative of Mr. Darwin's views.

Sir J.

Such a life-like representation as is here produced by a few rough scratches would not discredit a modern artist.

Lubbock has insisted, and with much reason, on the parallelism between the condition of existing savage races and that of fossil man; but, I would ask, is there any existing savage race capable of delineating animals in the masterly way in which the elephant is delineated on the plate of bone figured at page 326 of NATURE (February 27, 1873)? Such a life-like representation as is here produced by a few rough scratches would not discredit a modern artist. Unless I am under a misapprehension, the best figures that living savages can produce are but uncouth things, in which case either the parallelism between the intelligence of existing savage races and of fossil man fails in one important particular, or else a suspicion arises as to the contemporaneity of these engraved bones with pal\u00e6olithic man; and a doubt is thrown on the supposed antiquity of the Troglodytes to whose hands this engraving is ascribed.","dc.creator":["WOOD, SEARLES V."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["WOOD, SEARLES V."],"citation_author_institution":["Brentwood, Essex"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Antiquity of Man","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Antiquity of Man&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"007464a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

With entomologists I have frequently contended that so far from this being the case, there is, on the contrary, an almost marvellous agreement in the generic and specific names used, especially when we consider the extent of the bibliography and the vast number of the species. After reading in NATURE, vol. ix. p. 258, Mr. Wallace's review of Dr. Sharp's pamphlet, I bethought myself of comparing the two best known catalogues of European Coleoptera, viz., Schaum's, published at Berlin, in 1862, and De Marseul's, at Paris, in 1866. Perhaps the results of the examination of the first six families in the two works will suffice. It must be premised that Schaum's is strictly confined to European species, while De Marseul's embraces as well those of the \u201cbasin of the Mediterranean in Asia and Africa.\u201d As to the genera, in the Cicindelid\u00e6 there are two in each. In the Carabid\u00e6, Schaum has 98 genera and de Marseul 118; of the latter four are not adopted by Schaum and the remainder are extra-European. In the Dytiscid\u00e6 Schaum has 15 genera, De Marseul 17. In the Gyrinid\u00e6 there are two genera in Schaum, and three in De Marseul, the third being extra-European. Hydrophilid\u00e6 not having the same limitation in the two works, I take the Palpicorn families in which that group and the Sph\u00e6ridiid\u00e6 are included. There are 22 genera in each catalogue, but Schaum and De Marseul each ignore a genus adopted by the other, and a third name, Cyllidium, is preferred by the French author to the earlier one of Ch\u00e6tarthria. As to the species, seeing that Schaum has about 1,580 in the families mentioned above, and De Marseul 2,640, it would not be easy to compare them in a definite form; but taking Cicindela, the second genus of the two catalogues, the first having only one species, which is, I conceive, a fair example of the others, if indeed it has not had more than its share of varieties elevated to the rank of species, we find the 26 species in Schaum identical in names with the same species in De Marseul, except two varieties or species, and a synonym given with a? by Schaum, which is the right name according to De Marseul.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"9","prism.number":"226","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"321","prism.endingPage":"322","prism.copyright":"1874 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/009321b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/009321b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/009321b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/009321b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Zoological Nomenclature","citation_volume":"9","citation_issue":"226","citation_publication_date":"1874/02","citation_firstpage":"321","citation_lastpage":"322","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/009321b0","DOI":"10.1038/009321b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/009321b0","description":"FROM time to time an idea is started that Zoology is breaking down under the weight of its synonymy.

Perhaps the results of the examination of the first six families in the two works will suffice. It must be premised that Schaum's is strictly confined to European species, while De Marseul's embraces as well those of the \u201cbasin of the Mediterranean in Asia and Africa.\u201d As to the genera, in the Cicindelid\u00e6 there are two in each. In the Carabid\u00e6, Schaum has 98 genera and de Marseul 118; of the latter four are not adopted by Schaum and the remainder are extra-European. In the Dytiscid\u00e6 Schaum has 15 genera, De Marseul 17. In the Gyrinid\u00e6 there are two genera in Schaum, and three in De Marseul, the third being extra-European. Hydrophilid\u00e6 not having the same limitation in the two works, I take the Palpicorn families in which that group and the Sph\u00e6ridiid\u00e6 are included. There are 22 genera in each catalogue, but Schaum and De Marseul each ignore a genus adopted by the other, and a third name, Cyllidium, is preferred by the French author to the earlier one of Ch\u00e6tarthria. As to the species, seeing that Schaum has about 1,580 in the families mentioned above, and De Marseul 2,640, it would not be easy to compare them in a definite form; but taking Cicindela, the second genus of the two catalogues, the first having only one species, which is, I conceive, a fair example of the others, if indeed it has not had more than its share of varieties elevated to the rank of species, we find the 26 species in Schaum identical in names with the same species in De Marseul, except two varieties or species, and a synonym given with a? by Schaum, which is the right name according to De Marseul.","dc.creator":["PASCOE, FRANCIS P."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["PASCOE, FRANCIS P."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Zoological Nomenclature","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Zoological Nomenclature&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"009461b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The falling motion was very slow, I think it was visible for two minutes after the explosion, but though we tried more, than once to consult our watches, the light was insufficient.","dc.creator":["HIGGINS, HENRY H."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["HIGGINS, HENRY H."],"citation_author_institution":["Rainhill"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Bright Meteors","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Bright Meteors&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"010483f0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

There must be some misunderstanding here, for I have adduced proofs from Dubois-Reymond, Ranke, Fick, and others, and I believe all physiologists of note concur in the view as represented by me. The reviewer has apparently overlooked the circumstance that one of the principal points in the chapter was the distinction of the conveyance by nerves of the stimulus caused by electricity, and the mere conduction of an electric current, for he says \u201cthere is not the least doubt that it is through the nerve-fibres that electric stimulation will most readily and most powerfully affect muscular fibres at a distance.\u201d No one, I imagine, does doubt this, but it is not at all the same thing as saying that the nerve is the best medium for affecting the muscle owing to its superior power of conducting electricity, for it may also mean that the nerve is susceptible to the stimulus of electricity. This is, indeed, sufficiently shown by the fact that a mechanical stimulation of the nerve will have a similar effect, while we do not attribute to the nerve any superior power of conducting mechanical force. Permit me to refer to the additional light thrown on the question in the recently published work of Prof. Vulpian (\u201cLecons sur d'Ap-pareil Vaso-moteur,\u201d 1875). It had been asserted by Legros and Onimus, that on passing a galvanic current through a nerve containing vaso-motcr filaments, the ascending current caused contraction, while the descending ones produced dilatation of the capillary arteries. The experiments of Vulpian and Carville yielded results not in accordance with this statement, and both currents were found to cause contraction. Vulpian explains this discrepancy by pointing out that Legros and Onimus assumed to act on particular nerves by sending the current through the skin and subjacent parts. \u201cNot only,\u201d says Vulpian, \u201care we not authorised to believe that we act on these nerves by this mode, but, in addition, it is evident that we determine excitation of all the tissues comprehended in the current, the skin among others, and that that excitation may provoke reflex vascular dilatations which complicate the results\u201d (p. 114). To perform the experiment properly, it is necessary to secure isolation artificially by cutting the channels of reflex vaso-motor action. Again, it you electrify the sciatic nerve in a dog which has been curarised, no contraction of the voluntary muscles to which it is distributed takes place. And in paralysis of the radial nerve in man from cold, the power of volition over the muscles supplied by it is lost, while the sensory and vaso-motor filaments bound up in the same nerve retain their functional activity. In those cases the power of conducting electricity is not impaired, nor is it indeed in the dead body even; but here, as expressed by Vulpian, \u201cthe musculo-motor filaments have lost their normal aptitude to cause the muscular bundles to pass from the state of repose to the state of activity\u201d (p. 122). What that \u201cnormal aptitude\u201d consists in is still a question, but it is certainly not the power of conducting electricity, although a knowledge of the latter is of great importance in judging of Dr. Beale's theory of muscular contraction, Dr. Beale, as is well known, still holds to the opinion that the nerve-force is electricity, and that the nerves have not only the power of conducting electricity but of evolving it as a vital act on stimulation from the little masses of protoplasm, bioplasm, or living matter with which the nerve-cords are studded. Although there are many objections to this theory, still the badly-conducting power of the nerves for electricity does not appear an insuperable one when we think of the nerve-force merely as a stimulus, for the quantity of a stimulus necessary to rouse up vital action bears an infinitesimally small proportion to the result. But when the same force is assumed to be the efficient cause of muscular contraction, the question assumes a very different aspect. In Dr. Beale's theory the muscular fibre proper is held not to contain protoplasm, and to be incapable of living action or of evolving force, the contraction being produced by inductive electric action on the sarcous particles, which causes them to change their position and thus approximate the ends of the muscular fibre. The source of the electricity is said to be the protoplasm masses contained in the muscles, in continuous contact with the motor nerves, and it is conveyed to the muscular fibres by loops of fine nerve-fibres crossing them in various directions. In this theory, even supposing insulation to be complete, it is obvious that the conducting power of the nerve-fibre becomes of supreme importance, because not the stimulus only, but the whole force of muscular motion, must be conveyed by it. Now, the nerve-cords do conduct electricity certainly, but so many million times worse than metallic wires, that the loss of energy by transformation into heat must be enormous. Such a loss is inconsistent with the economy of nature and with the actual facts; therefore, unless the nerve-force is a specific force different from surface-electricity, galvanism, and magnetism, though analogous to them, and probably easily convertible into electricity, Dr. Beale's theory cannot be upheld. I have not yet seen any reply by Dr. Beale to this objection.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"11","prism.number":"274","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"247","prism.endingPage":"248","prism.copyright":"1875 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/011247b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/011247b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/011247b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/011247b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Electric Conductivity of Nerves","citation_volume":"11","citation_issue":"274","citation_publication_date":"1875/01","citation_firstpage":"247","citation_lastpage":"248","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/011247b0","DOI":"10.1038/011247b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/011247b0","description":"IN a recent number of NATURE (vol. x. p. 519) the reviewer of \u201cThe Protoplasmic Theory of Life\u201d states broadly that few physiologists will agree with the statement in the book that the nerves are not better fitted for the conduction of electric currents than the other moist tissues, and that they possess no demonstrable apparatus for insulation of these currents.

I have not yet seen any reply by Dr. Beale to this objection.","dc.creator":["DRYSDALE, JOHN"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["DRYSDALE, JOHN"],"citation_author_institution":["Liverpool"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Electric Conductivity of Nerves","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Electric Conductivity of Nerves&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"011269c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

STEPHEN WILSON remarks, in his note on this subject (NATURE, vol. xiii., p. 428), \u201cWhy the seed generally becomes twisted as it dries is a very interesting question. But what seems to me the most remarkable fact about this phenomon is, that in every case, and in all trees alike, the thread of the screw is in one direction.\u201d He also alludes to the uniformity in the direction of torsion in the awns of two species of oat. Torsion of all kinds occurring in plants is usually assumed to be due to unequal longitudinal tension (see Sach's \u201cHandbook,\u201d p. 770). In a paper read before the Linnean Society, March 16, I pointed out that the uniformity in the direction of the torsion cannot be thus accounted for; and a totally different explanation was given of the twisting and untwisting of the awns of certain fruits (Avena elatior among the number) when they are dried and moistened. It was shown that the power of torsion resides in the individual cells of which the awn is constructed, and tha it is by their combined action that the awn, as a whole, becomes twisted in drying. It appeared to me extremely probable that the same explanation would hold good for the twisted wing of the ash fruit. I therefore boiled one in nitric acid and chlorate of potassium, by which means the woody tissue is separated into its constituent cells. These were then teazed out on a slip of glass and thoroughly dried over a lamp, and it was found that many of them had become twisted on their axes; and, which is important, that they were all twisted in the same direction as the fruit itself. This artificial drying represents the natural drying process which occurs during the ripening of the fruit. In both cases contraction and consequent torsion result from the loss of water, but in the natural process the cells not being free to twist independently, are compelled to combine in producing that torsion of the whole fruit which we are considering. It is interesting to find the same principle holding good in the case of the ash screw as in that of the awns of various Gramine\u00e6 and Geraniace\u00e6, and the twisted tails of the achenes in Anemone montana. Moreover, I strongly suspect that the principle of the torsion of an organ being dependent on the twisting of its constituent cells is capable of wider extension, so as to embrace the torsion of the stems of twining plants, &c. This subject I hope immediately to investigate.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"13","prism.number":"337","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"465","prism.endingPage":"465","prism.copyright":"1876 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/013465c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/013465c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/013465c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/013465c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Ash Seed Screw","citation_volume":"13","citation_issue":"337","citation_publication_date":"1876/04","citation_firstpage":"465","citation_lastpage":"465","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/013465c0","DOI":"10.1038/013465c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/013465c0","description":"MR.

Torsion of all kinds occurring in plants is usually assumed to be due to unequal longitudinal tension (see Sach's \u201cHandbook,\u201d p. 770). In a paper read before the Linnean Society, March 16, I pointed out that the uniformity in the direction of the torsion cannot be thus accounted for; and a totally different explanation was given of the twisting and untwisting of the awns of certain fruits (Avena elatior among the number) when they are dried and moistened. It was shown that the power of torsion resides in the individual cells of which the awn is constructed, and tha it is by their combined action that the awn, as a whole, becomes twisted in drying. It appeared to me extremely probable that the same explanation would hold good for the twisted wing of the ash fruit. I therefore boiled one in nitric acid and chlorate of potassium, by which means the woody tissue is separated into its constituent cells. These were then teazed out on a slip of glass and thoroughly dried over a lamp, and it was found that many of them had become twisted on their axes; and, which is important, that they were all twisted in the same direction as the fruit itself. This artificial drying represents the natural drying process which occurs during the ripening of the fruit. In both cases contraction and consequent torsion result from the loss of water, but in the natural process the cells not being free to twist independently, are compelled to combine in producing that torsion of the whole fruit which we are considering. It is interesting to find the same principle holding good in the case of the ash screw as in that of the awns of various Gramine\u00e6 and Geraniace\u00e6, and the twisted tails of the achenes in Anemone montana. Moreover, I strongly suspect that the principle of the torsion of an organ being dependent on the twisting of its constituent cells is capable of wider extension, so as to embrace the torsion of the stems of twining plants, &c. This subject I hope immediately to investigate.","dc.creator":["DARWIN, FRANCIS"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["DARWIN, FRANCIS"],"citation_author_institution":["Down, Beckenham"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Ash Seed Screw","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Ash Seed Screw&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"013510b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The consequence will be that in dealing with a series of barometric observations in these latitudes, the mean difference of individual observations from the mean of the whole series, or in other words, the mean irregularity, will not be materially modified by the introduction of the comparatively small semi-diurnal variation. But this is no argument against the existence of such a variation, nor is the fact that at Madras the mean rainfall irregularity is not greatly reduced by the introduction of an eleven-yearly cycle any argument against the existence of such a cycle. As a matter of fact, this mean irregularity is reduced, although perhaps not very markedly by the introduction of this cycle. The true test of a physical cycle is its repetition, and, since in the present important aspect of this question we cannot, perhaps, calmly wait for other sixty-four years' observations before venturing a conclusion, let us now endeavour to break these sixty-four years up into periods, and see whether we obtain any traces of physical persistence from this method.

But this is no argument against the existence of such a variation, nor is the fact that at Madras the mean rainfall irregularity is not greatly reduced by the introduction of an eleven-yearly cycle any argument against the existence of such a cycle. As a matter of fact, this mean irregularity is reduced, although perhaps not very markedly by the introduction of this cycle. The true test of a physical cycle is its repetition, and, since in the present important aspect of this question we cannot, perhaps, calmly wait for other sixty-four years' observations before venturing a conclusion, let us now endeavour to break these sixty-four years up into periods, and see whether we obtain any traces of physical persistence from this method. Grouping, as Dr. Hunter has done, the sixty-four years' Madras rainfall into series of eleven years, beginning with the first in 1813, we obtain the following table:\u2014","dc.creator":["STEWART, BALFOUR"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["STEWART, BALFOUR"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Indian Rainfall and Sun-spots","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Indian Rainfall and Sun-spots&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"016183c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Naturally his candles burnt with inferior combustion there. I have for years together burnt Newcastle coal, and no other; and for years together burnt South Staffordshire coal, and no other; and I say that sunshine puts out a sea-coal fire and not a S.S. fire.

Now, if the sun is shining on the coal, that last faint gleam is invisible, and the fire goes out as a matter of course. Sunshine puts out a sea-coal fire by insidiously eclipsing the warning glimmer of its expiring embers. This, at least, is a vera causa.

With great interest, not unmixed with curiosity, I have observed (my attention was at first casually excited) that bees particularly, and also butterflies, visit a distinct variety and for the time confine their attention to it, settling on and sucking the honey of that variety only; e.g., a bee settling on a scarlet geranium will not go from it to another species or variety, but gives its attention to the particular variety only, irrespective of colour, whether scarlet, pink, or white, never going from a scarlet geranium to another scarlet flower, even if in contact.

The indiscriminate admixture of the pollens of distinct varieties would probably frustrate the ends of nature and lead to monstrosities or barrenness.

That he had a view of the planet as stated there is no doubt, for I myself saw it some four or five minutes later, using \u03b8 as a comparison star, and am able not only to corroborate the discovery, but to substantiate the position given by him. Its proximity to \u03b8 enabled me to estimate its position with great exactness, especially in declination. It may be well here to state that I was prevented from searching to the east of the sun, in consequence of forgetting to untie a string with which I had tied, to the eye end of the telescope, a long pole to prevent the wind from shaking it, the end resting on the ground not allowing the instrument to be moved to the eastward. It is undoubtedly to this circumstance, which at the time seemed untoward, that I owe the discovery of Vulcan.

Almost at once my eye caught two red stars about 3\u00b0 south-west of the sun, with large, round, and equally bright discs, which I estimated as of the fifth magnitude, appearing (this was my thought at the time) about as bright in the telescope as the pole star does to the naked eye. I then carefully noted their distances from the sun and from each other, and the direction in which they pointed, &c., and recorded them in my memory, where, to my mind's eye, they are still distinctly visible. I then swept southward, not daring to venture far to the west for fear I should be unable to get back again, and soon came upon two stars resembling in every particular the former two I had found, and, sighting along the outside of the tube, was surprised to find I was viewing the same objects. Again I observed them with the utmost care, and then recommenced my sweeps in another direction, but I soon had them again, and for the third time in the field. This was also the last, as a small cloud hindered a final leave-taking just before the end of totality, as I had intended.

Notwithstanding this assertion, I would suggest that the writer in the Engineer is right. Twenty-five years ago, when an engineering student, I was taught that sea-beach travelling was due to wind-waves. Afterwards, while knocking about during fifteen years in the vicinity of the south and west coasts of Ireland, I noted facts that went to show that such a theory was not universally correct. This led me to study wind-action on the sea and lakes, also all I could find that had been written on the subject; the result being that as good evidence was so contradictory, no opinion could be come to from the evidence of others. But it was not till about ten years ago, when I was so circumstanced that I could properly study wave-action, and after six years' careful observation on the south-east coast of lreland, that I found that tidal currents were the principal motive power; and on again reading what had been written on the subject, that I found that nearly all the advocates for the driftage of sea beaches by wind-waves had studied on beaches where the most continuous and powerful winds acted in conjunction with the flow-tide current. As the results of my observations have been published in the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, English and Irish Institutions of Civil Engineers, the Geological Societies of London, Dublin, &c., during the last six or eight years, it is unnecessary to repeat them here. I would, however, point out that when there are only wind-waves and no tidal currents, the beaches as a general rule are banked up, but do not travel (the writer in NATURE seems to have observed this, but does not appear to see the importance of it). This may be seen in the tideless Mediterranean, as pointed out by the late Dr. Ansted in his paper on the Lagoons at the Delta of the Rhone; it may also be seen in Malcombe, or any other bay where there is a \u201chead of the tide\u201d but no tidal current; and in the different freshwater lakes, when the wind-waves are the only motive power. But wherever there are tidal currents acting on a coast the beach must travel. Such tidal currents are those that most perplex the erectors of groynes. If there was only the travelling augmented by wind-waves, the erection of groynes would be very simple; but, as a general rule, they are most necessary where there are strong tidal currents (or conflicting currents) due to the regular \u201cflow\u201d tide, \u201chalf counter\u201d tides, or \u201con-shore\u201d tides; which conflicting currents, combined with the action of wind-waves, let them be direct or as \u201cground swells,\u201d make up all the \u201ccutting-out tides.\u201d The greater the complications the greater the \u201ccutting out,\u201d and the more ingenious have to be the groynes. \u201cFulls\u201d accumulate with the wind-waves, but rapidly disappear when the wind ceases.

On September 10, in a gathering of pond-water made in this neighbourhood and brought home for microscopical examination, a somewhat singular and unusual object presented itself, but speedily making its way to the sediment at the bottom, it became lost to fight. Upon the evening of the 12th, or after the lapse of fully two days, while holding the bottle to the light, the same object again appeared, swimming or flying in mid-water with a peculiar jerky movement resembling that of some of the Entomostraca, and for one of which I at first mistook it.

On September 10, in a gathering of pond-water made in this neighbourhood and brought home for microscopical examination, a somewhat singular and unusual object presented itself, but speedily making its way to the sediment at the bottom, it became lost to fight. Upon the evening of the 12th, or after the lapse of fully two days, while holding the bottle to the light, the same object again appeared, swimming or flying in mid-water with a peculiar jerky movement resembling that of some of the Entomostraca, and for one of which I at first mistook it. On removal by means of a dipping-tube to a zoophyte trough for fuller examination, it proved, to my great surprise, to be one of the small Hymenopterous flies of the Proctotrupid family, and here it continued its active movements, now walking and running upon the bottom and sides of the trough, now flying, as it were, through mid-water by the energetic movements of its wings, but apparently making no effort to escape.

I allude to the construction and working of the Channel Tunnel Railway. Of course the direct application of steam-power to the work of boring is out of the question. The power employed in boring Mont Cenis and St. Gothard was transmitted by compressed air through metal tubes, but this is a very costly, wasteful, and in some respects inconvenient process; and this cost and waste increases in a very high ratio to the distance of transmission. Since those works were executed an immense advance has been made in the practice of transmitting energy by electric current, and particularly in storing that energy; and I predict that if the tunnel is ever completed (which I do not doubt) it will be by means of electrical agency. An eminent civil engineer, who had invented a boring-machine which he considered of great promise for that work, told me more than a year ago that Dr. Siemens assured him that he would undertake to transmit 50 per cent, of the initial power by electric current half way through the tunnel; and by this time he would most probably give a much larger percentage. An eminent French authority promises from sixteen to twenty horse-power by a, single current over a distance of from ten to fifty kilometres. If these statements are founded on fact your readers will at once realise the applicability and potency of the agent. Then there must of necessity be an immense quantity of material to be carried to and fro. The electrical railways of Berlin, Brussels, and Paris have left no question open as to the easiest and most economical means of propelling the trollies; and by using several conductors as many trolly trains in succession could be run as there would be conductors. It would be premature to discuss now the subject of working this railway, but it is certain, that electricity will be the agent, and there is very little doubt that the twenty miles of level tunnel way will be worked by energy generated and stored by the train itself in its descent from the land level to the tunnel level. An examination of this question in detail would be incompatible with your space and purpose. I will simply say that a train of 100 tons descending a gradient of 1 in 100 for five miles would start with a potential force of nearly 60,000,000 foot pounds, a very small portion of which would be expended in useful work. Let the surplus of this be applied not to destroying the rails by brakes and conversion into useless heat, but by revolving generators and storing the product to be used in again turning the generators (now motors) for propelling the train.

A somewhat small ovate specimen of great interest was found by one of my correspondents in the gravel excavated for the New Albert Dock, the extension of the Victoria Dock. The object of the greatest interest was a rude scraper-like tool made from a somewhat large piece of tabular flint, and found in gravel excavated between Loughton Railway Station and the \u201cRobin Hood\u201d Tavern, undoubtedly artificial and pal\u00e6olithic; this ancient gravel is I think usually placed in the Glacial series; the find must be accepted as genuine. I may say here that on the 23rd of this month I found another implement and six flakes in gravel brought from Ware.","dc.creator":["SMITH, WORTHINGTON G."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["SMITH, WORTHINGTON G."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Prim\u00e6val Man and Working-Men Students","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Prim&#230;val Man and Working-Men Students&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"028342c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The sky was nearly clear when the sun set at 4.18, and the air transparent. A few cirrccumulus fleeces became lighted up with a pink and then with a deep red colour immediately after sunset. A very peculiar greenish and white opalescent haze now appeared about the point of the sun's departure, and shone as if with a light of its own, near the horizon. The upper part of this pearly mist soon assumed a pink colour, while the lower part was white, green, and greenish-yellow. About 4.35 the sky from near the horizon towards the zenith had begun to turn to a brilliant but delicate pink, and some pink cirrus-like streaks stretched apparently horizontally towards the south-east. The coloured portion of the sky spread out like a sheaf from the horizon, and apparently consisted of a very high, thin filmy cirrus disposed in transverse bands or ripples, close together, and very delicate in form, outline, and tint. Below the pink, and between it and the point where the sun had set, remained the very curions, opalescent, shining, green and white vapour, hanging, as it were, vertically, and changing very little during many minutes. The borders of the pink sheaf were definite, and finely contrasted with the deep blue sky. As darkness came on, the pink glow seemed to increase in brightness, and at five o'clock cast a fine weird light over the hills. The moon was now bright in the south-east, and began to cast dark shadows. About five the colour slowly receded from the part nearest the zenith towards the horizon, and as it retired left a clearly visible filmy ripple of cirrus of a faint gray tint. At 5.25 the greater part of the colour was gone, and the cloud remained bright only near the horizon. At 5.32, however, it began to grow again, and in a short time (5.40) the whole extent of the film was again glowing bright pink, producing a most striking effect in contrast with the silvery moon, dark sky, and bright stars in the north and east. The pink light then slowly withdrew towards the horizon, remaining bright and deep coloured low down till 5.50. At 5.58 the last pink disappeared. The whole phenomenon from first to last was in the highest degree peculiar and striking. It was remarkable, first, for the interval which elapsed between the time of sunset and the time at which the cloud became bright, next for the light, filmy character of the cloud, thirdly for the bright green glow near the place of sunset, fourthly for the small transverse ripple form of the cloud, fifthly for the permanence of shape and immobility of the cloud, sixthly for the very long endurance of the coloured reflected sunlight after sunset, one hour and forty minutes, and seventhly for the second illumination, which began more than an hour after sunset. It was certainly due to cirrus or a higher kind of cloud, because (1) parts of the illuminated sky stretched in long streaks southwards, and the glow remained long in these streaks, resembling very high cirrus; (2) when the light left the sky the first time, the part which had been illuminated remained visible as silvery gray cloud ripples, before the second after-glow rekindled it, and (3) because the colour became very gradually darker as time went on, and because the recessions of light both times were towards the place of sunset. A similar very high cirrus had also been specially marked long after sunset on November 8, and about the time of sunrise on November 9. The night following this rare display was exceedingly clear and fine. This evening (November 10) the light, high cirrus, all but invisible in full daylight, with its delicate ripples, assumed the pink tint about fifteen minutes after sunset, showing the upper air to be in the same abnormal condition as yesterday, and the phenomenon was feebly repeated.

The effects decrease from the engine to the end of the train, and are practically unobservable in the last few coaches.","dc.creator":["VICARS, GEORGE RAYLEIGH"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["VICARS, GEORGE RAYLEIGH"],"citation_author_institution":["Rugby"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Ear a Barometer","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Ear a Barometer&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"029550a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

E. Hill, M.A., F.G.S., Tutor of St. John's College, Cambridge.\u2014On the Montreal Mountain, in the neighbouring quarries, at the mouth of the Saguenay River, and more or less everywhere over all Canada and all the north and north-west of this continent, are seen phenomena which imply a former vastly extended action of ice. The like are found over Europe and Asia, thus completely encircling the Pole. Many theories have been propounded to account for these facts. It is proposed to pass these before you in review. Any explanation ought to account not only for cold greater than the present, but for accumulations of snow and ice. A kindred phenomenon is the greater size of the Antarctic ice-cap. The supposed interglacial warm periods, and the unquestioned luxuriance of Miocene vegetation in Greenland, ought also to find their causes in any thoroughly satisfactory theory. The theories which have been propounded fall into three groups, as Cosmical, Terrestrial, and Astronomical (or Periodical). The Cosmical theories arc Poisson's Cold-Space theory\u2014incomprehensible; and the Cold-Sun theory of S. V. Wood and others\u2014lacking any evidence. The Terrestrial theories are numerous. Lyell's suggestion of Polar-continent and Equatorial-ocean is opposed by evidence that continents and oceans lay on much the same areas as now. The contrary view, Polar-ocean and Equatorial-land, would deserve consideration but for the same opposing evidence. The elevation view (Dana, Wallace), which alleges greater altitude of mountain-chains, disagrees with the strong evidence for land-depression during the period. The submergence view of Dr. Dawson agrees with this evidence, but requires elucidation. Alteration of ocean-currents (Gunn, J. S. Gardiner) is a most powerful agency, but would act locally rather than universally round the Pole. Alteration of prevalent winds, hitherto worked out by no one, deserves attentive consideration. Conditions are conceivable which would produce over an area owinds from cold quarters almost permanently. However, this seems open to the same objection as the preceding theory. Last come the Astronomical or Periodical theories. A tilt of the earth's axis was suggested by Belt, but suggested as owing to causes which are wholly insufficient. Tilting from astronomical agencies is slight, though its action would be in the direction required. Herschel suggested the Eccentricity theory, but abandoned it. Adh\u00e9mar's Precession theory, as explained by himself, involved an absolute fallacy. The celebrated view of Dr. Croll combines the Precession and Eccentricity theories into one. It exactly agrees with the Antarctic greater extension of ice, and provides an explanation of interglacial warm periods. The great difficulty in its way is to see how a mere difference in distribution through the year of an unchanged total heat-receipt can produce consequences so vast. The laws of radiation explain tut a very minute part, the laws of evaporation perhaps rather more; but, so far as can at present be seen, both together are inadequate. Another serious objection is that the theory seems to require the climate of the northern hemisphere to be now in a state of change for the better, of which at present there appears no evidence. Dr. Croll's elaborate explanations of the reaction of one effect upon another\u2014fogs, deflection of currents, and the like\u2014have no special connection with his own theory. They would act in all cases, and support all theories equally. The arguments, if admitted, would only prove that the earth's climates are in a state of highly unstable equilibrium, in which a slight cause may produce an enormous change. Nor are his arguments universally admitted. In conclusion, Dr. Croll's theory seems inadequate: alteration of currents and winds are the most powerful causes suggested hitherto: further investigations ought to be made as to the nature and extent of the last series of changes in the outlines of the continents of the globe.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"30","prism.number":"778","prism.section":"BriefCommunication","prism.startingPage":"526","prism.endingPage":"531","prism.copyright":"1884 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/030526a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/030526a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/030526a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/030526a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The British Association: Section C\u2014Geology","citation_volume":"30","citation_issue":"778","citation_publication_date":"1884/09","citation_firstpage":"526","citation_lastpage":"531","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/030526a0","DOI":"10.1038/030526a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/030526a0","description":"On Ice-Age Theories, by Rev.

Last come the Astronomical or Periodical theories. A tilt of the earth's axis was suggested by Belt, but suggested as owing to causes which are wholly insufficient. Tilting from astronomical agencies is slight, though its action would be in the direction required. Herschel suggested the Eccentricity theory, but abandoned it. Adh\u00e9mar's Precession theory, as explained by himself, involved an absolute fallacy. The celebrated view of Dr. Croll combines the Precession and Eccentricity theories into one. It exactly agrees with the Antarctic greater extension of ice, and provides an explanation of interglacial warm periods. The great difficulty in its way is to see how a mere difference in distribution through the year of an unchanged total heat-receipt can produce consequences so vast. The laws of radiation explain tut a very minute part, the laws of evaporation perhaps rather more; but, so far as can at present be seen, both together are inadequate. Another serious objection is that the theory seems to require the climate of the northern hemisphere to be now in a state of change for the better, of which at present there appears no evidence. Dr. Croll's elaborate explanations of the reaction of one effect upon another\u2014fogs, deflection of currents, and the like\u2014have no special connection with his own theory. They would act in all cases, and support all theories equally. The arguments, if admitted, would only prove that the earth's climates are in a state of highly unstable equilibrium, in which a slight cause may produce an enormous change. Nor are his arguments universally admitted. In conclusion, Dr. Croll's theory seems inadequate: alteration of currents and winds are the most powerful causes suggested hitherto: further investigations ought to be made as to the nature and extent of the last series of changes in the outlines of the continents of the globe.","dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["\"Economic Geology of India,\" and \"A Geologist's Contribution to the History of India,\" Proc.

It appears afraid to attack its young rival, but runs towards it as if it meant to do so, and when the young one turns round and faces it, the old one crouches down so that nothing of it is seen hut a crest-like back, two glaring eyes, the spotted throat, and a dark line formed by the front view of the beak and the lines at the corners of the mouth, which look very much like a serpent's mouth. If I saw the creature protruding from a bush or from the grass, I should certainly take it for a snake of some kind.

No sooner has it recovered its courage and advanced to attack than the old one retreats, and resumes its serpent-like mask.

A short time ago, when the ground was for a long time hard from frost and drought, this thrush moped about and seemed nearly starved, and at last fell upon two great clumps of yellow crocuses, and not only tore them to pieces, as if in a rage, but devoured them entirely, returning again and again to them, and gobbling up the yellow petals as a rabbit does a lettuce. At that time many birds that are usually too shy came down from the hills and strolled about the fields and lawns\u2014snipes, plovers, &c.

The Pal\u00e6ozoic sediments are certainly not banks, but sheets originally spread over the sea-bed, and distributed according to certain recognised laws of increase and decrease of thickness.","dc.creator":["HULL, EDWARD"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["HULL, EDWARD"],"citation_author_institution":["Dublin"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Geological Age of the North Atlantic Ocean","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Geological Age of the North Atlantic Ocean&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"034571b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Speaking before the South African Philosophical Society in February 1883, I said:\u2014\u201cMembers of the Society will see on the table a scorpion of the larger (Cape) species. That scorpion I caught at 11 o'clock this morning. I at once pierced him in three places with his own sting, on which in each case there was a drop of poison. In the last inoculation I held the sting in the wound, and squeezing the \u2018bulb of the sting\u2019 with the pincers forcibly injected poison.

Speaking before the South African Philosophical Society in February 1883, I said:\u2014\u201cMembers of the Society will see on the table a scorpion of the larger (Cape) species. That scorpion I caught at 11 o'clock this morning. I at once pierced him in three places with his own sting, on which in each case there was a drop of poison. In the last inoculation I held the sting in the wound, and squeezing the \u2018bulb of the sting\u2019 with the pincers forcibly injected poison. The creature is alive and active\u201d (Proceedings for 1883). These and subsequent experiments, however, led me to believe that the poison has some effect, causing sluggishness and torpor for a while.

According to both, the sunlight scattered at right angles to its original direction by very small particles is completely polarized in a plane through the sun. In observation, however, we find the light from a region of the sky distant 90\u00b0 from the sun is only partially polarized. This is due to that portion of the atmosphere being illuminated not merely by the sun, but also by the rest of the sky and the surface of the earth, and partly also no doubt to some of the particles not being sufficiently small compared with a wave-length. From these considerations we may expect that a fall of snow would cause a considerable diminution of the polarization. This expectation has been fulfilled in some recent observations of mine here at 6000 feet above sea-level. My polarimeter consists essentially of two piles of glass plates to depolarize the sky light; and a crystal and Nicol prism to test the depolarization. Owing to the strength of the polarization at this attitude, I find it necessary to use two piles of glass plates separated by two or three inches. This arrangement diminishes the number of double internal reflections, and so is a much more powerful polarizer or depolarizer than the same number of plates combined into one pile. As I have not seen this important practical consideration noticed before, I may point out that, in addition to the light refracted directly through the pile, there are a number of portions twice reflected. One of these for instance is reflected first at the second surface of the last plate, and secondly at the first surface of the last plate. The number of such twice-reflected portions for n plates is n (2n - 1). When, as in my instrument, the fixed pile is much inclined, no light can reach the edge after being reflected first by one pile and then by the other. If the two piles were combined into one, I should have 120 portions twice reflected; as it is, I have only 60. This increases the polarizing power of the instrument by at least one-third.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"37","prism.number":"947","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"177","prism.endingPage":"178","prism.copyright":"1887 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/037177b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/037177b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/037177b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/037177b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Effect of Snow on the Polarization of the Sky","citation_volume":"37","citation_issue":"947","citation_publication_date":"1887/12","citation_firstpage":"177","citation_lastpage":"178","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/037177b0","DOI":"10.1038/037177b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/037177b0","description":"THE polarization of the sky has been shown experimentally by Tyndall and theoretically by Lord Rayleigh to be due to fine particles suspended in the atmosphere.

Four of the implements\u20141386, 1387, 1393, and 1398 in my collection\u2014are from Caddington: height above Ordnance datum, 595 feet 9 inches. The dry valley close by, to the west, is 470 feet, and the ground gradually falls southwards to 409 feet at the source of the Ver, near Markyate Street, at a distance of 1 3/4 mile. The sections at Caddington exhibit red \u201cclay with flints,\u201d brick earth (or clay), and tenacious brown clay or loam, surmounted by blackish earth, containing broken white-coated flints, a few ochreous flints, and numerous blackish Tertiary pebbles. The whole deposit rests on chalk, and varies in depth from 2 feet to 50 feet. Aware of the importance of finding the worked flints in the undisturbed material, I have, after long searching, found a single implement and one or two flakes in situ at the stony bottom of the upper deposit of tenacious brown clay at a depth of 3 and 4 feet from the surface. A single small Pal\u00e6olithic implement I have found on the surface at Kensworth: height above Ordnance datum, 759 feet 8 inches. The bottom of the valley, 1\u00bc mile to the west, at the source of the Ouzel, is 414 feet. Half an ovate Pal\u00e6olithic implement, obviously derived from the hill-tops, I have found in a field at the bottom of a chalky valley near Houghton Regis. The Caddington implements are pointed (or tongue-shaped), slightly abraded, small in size, and cinnamon-brown in colour. The interest attached to these finds rests not only on the great heights mentioned and the positions away from existing river valleys, but in the nature, age, and mode of deposit of the upper tenacious brown clay in which the implements are embedded. The implements themselves agree in make and appearance with the well-known brown or ochreous implements often found in non-ochreous sand, &c., in existing river valleys. I have at present seen no traces of fossil bones or fresh-water shells in the deposits mentioned.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"40","prism.number":"1024","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"151","prism.endingPage":"151","prism.copyright":"1889 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/040151a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/040151a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/040151a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/040151a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Pal\u00e6olithic Implements from the Hills near Dunstable","citation_volume":"40","citation_issue":"1024","citation_publication_date":"1889/06","citation_firstpage":"151","citation_lastpage":"151","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/040151a0","DOI":"10.1038/040151a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/040151a0","description":"DURING the past twelve months I have found a small number of Pal\u00e6olithic implements at great elevations in North Hertfordshire and South Bedfordshire, unconnected with existing river valleys.

The sections at Caddington exhibit red \u201cclay with flints,\u201d brick earth (or clay), and tenacious brown clay or loam, surmounted by blackish earth, containing broken white-coated flints, a few ochreous flints, and numerous blackish Tertiary pebbles. The whole deposit rests on chalk, and varies in depth from 2 feet to 50 feet. Aware of the importance of finding the worked flints in the undisturbed material, I have, after long searching, found a single implement and one or two flakes in situ at the stony bottom of the upper deposit of tenacious brown clay at a depth of 3 and 4 feet from the surface. A single small Pal\u00e6olithic implement I have found on the surface at Kensworth: height above Ordnance datum, 759 feet 8 inches. The bottom of the valley, 1\u00bc mile to the west, at the source of the Ouzel, is 414 feet. Half an ovate Pal\u00e6olithic implement, obviously derived from the hill-tops, I have found in a field at the bottom of a chalky valley near Houghton Regis. The Caddington implements are pointed (or tongue-shaped), slightly abraded, small in size, and cinnamon-brown in colour. The interest attached to these finds rests not only on the great heights mentioned and the positions away from existing river valleys, but in the nature, age, and mode of deposit of the upper tenacious brown clay in which the implements are embedded. The implements themselves agree in make and appearance with the well-known brown or ochreous implements often found in non-ochreous sand, &c., in existing river valleys. I have at present seen no traces of fossil bones or fresh-water shells in the deposits mentioned.","dc.creator":["SMITH, WORTHINGTON G."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["SMITH, WORTHINGTON G."],"citation_author_institution":["Dunstable"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Pal\u00e6olithic Implements from the Hills near...","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Pal&#230;olithic Implements from the Hills near Dunstable&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"040203c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It does not seem likely that any arrangement for the organ would be practically adopted unless it permits as much freedom of modulation and of execution as that of equal temperament. To permit perfectly free modulation, with practically perfect intervals, nothing short of the cycle of fifty-three will suffice. Now to construct a key-board with fifty-three notes to the octave which can be played upon with the facility of a twelve-note key-board seems impossible. But the problem may be approached differently: as it is only necessary to use twelve notes at a time, the key-board might remain as it is, and only a mechanical device would be required to make these twelve keys correspond to the right twelve out of fifty-three pipes; if the services of an assistant be allowed (as is often necessary on large organs) the mechanical difficulties could easily be overcome. For example, arrange a number of studs\u2014say 117, as suggested by Dr. Ellis\u2014as a \u201cduodenarium,\u201d and connected electrically to the fifty-three trackers; i.e. each tracker would be connected to two or three studs\u2014 B3\u266d\u266d, C4\u266d\u266d\u266d, A3\u266f studs to tracker 46 for instance. Opposite these studs would be another set of 117 connected to the twelve keys, e.g. C, B2\u266f, B3\u266f, D2\u266d\u266d, &c., all to the key C. Between the two sets of studs would be a frame carrying twelve contact pieces; the frame would then be moved along guides by the assistant, so that the twelve keys were electrically connected to the right duodene of studs, and hence could be made to open the right group of pipes.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"44","prism.number":"1144","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"519","prism.endingPage":"519","prism.copyright":"1891 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/044519d0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/044519d0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/044519d0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/044519d0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Instruments in Just Intonation","citation_volume":"44","citation_issue":"1144","citation_publication_date":"1891/10","citation_firstpage":"519","citation_lastpage":"519","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/044519d0","DOI":"10.1038/044519d0","citation_doi":"10.1038/044519d0","description":"AS you have raised once more the question of justly intoned instruments, may I offer the following remarks? It does not seem likely that any arrangement for the organ would be practically adopted unless it permits as much freedom of modulation and of execution as that of equal temperament. To permit perfectly free modulation, with practically perfect intervals, nothing short of the cycle of fifty-three will suffice. Now to construct a key-board with fifty-three notes to the octave which can be played upon with the facility of a twelve-note key-board seems impossible.

The mountain is a very difficult one to study, on account of the difficulty of reaching the most interesting part. Taking a sort of botanical section from the shore of the Albert Edward Nyanza, one finds first a series of grassy plains covered with Andropogous some two feet high, and in certain months supporting large herds of elephants, Kudu, and Lurwali antelopes. This is in part the old level of the lake, and in part gravel and sand brought by the numerous rivers; in places it is dotted by Acacia and the tree Euphorbia, which has something of the appearance of an enormous chandelier. After leaving this plain, one comes to a series of small hills from 4000 to 5000 feet in height, which have been apparently cut out of the mountain by the numerous rivers and streams. Some of these are covered with patches of cultivation, banana plantations, &c.; usually these are hidden from the main road. When one reaches the mountain proper, one finds up to 7000 feet a steep ascent covered with grass and small shrubs, usually three to four feet high. The valleys in this part are usually very steep V-shaped trenches, and cultivation is abundant everywhere, sometimes over 7000 feet, and in the Wakondja country the edible Arum is grown up to 7400 feet or more. This height, 7000 to 8000 feet, marks the beginning of the forest. It is composed of deciduous trees, sometimes with a very thick undergrowth; sometimes it is pretty open, with a profusion of fern and moss on the old trunks, and creepers in some places. I have found tree ferns and Begonia, but usually the flowers are rather pale in colour, or quite inconspicuous. At 8600 feet another distinct change takes place, and a wilderness of decaying young and mature bamboos replaces the trees. Here and there these are hung with creepers, but the predominant feature is the wetness of everything. Moss covers almost every trunk below, and amongst the roots are only very watery plants, such as Urticace\u00e6. At 9600 feet another change takes place; bamboos disappear completely, and tree heather takes its place. In a dry part of the mountain one finds a charming little violet, a Cardamine, Galiums, Epilobium, Rubus, &c.

In my letter, published December 6, I defended Lamarck's laws against the accusation that they were reciprocally destructive. Prof. Lankester reiterates his accusation without any further support. But this is not the whole question. In his last letter he suggests that acquired characters corresponding to Mr. Galton's definition should be taken, and an investigation made as to whether they are inherited or not in later generations. But in his former letter (November 29) he suggested very distinctly and deliberately that such an investigation was unnecessary, because the question was already settled. He has already condemned the heretic, and now consents to his trial. His words were\u2014\u201cSince the old character had not become fixed and congenital after many thousands of successive generations of individuals had developed it in response to environment, but gave place to a new character when new conditions operated on an individual, why should we suppose that the new character is likely to become fixed after a much shorter time of responsive existence?\u201d To apply this once more to the case of pigment in relation to light. For thousands of generations no pigment has been developed, say, on the lower side of a flat fish, no light having fallen on it. The skin is experimentally exposed to light, and pigment appears: therefore the acquired character of absence of pigment, after thousands of generations, has produced no hereditary change, has not altered the potentialities of the tissue. The argument is fallacious, because the question of how much pigment is entirely ignored, and also the question how long the development of pigment experimentally takes. The force of the argument is entirely on the other side. Assume in this case, as Prof. Lankester does in his general argument, that the old character, the absence of pigment, is an acquired character. Then experiment has shown that this character is inherited: that is to say, the action of light obviously overcomes a resistance in producing pigment, and after years does not produce as much as on the upper side is present from the beginning. This resistance can be nothing else than heredity, the inheritance of a tendency to pigmentlessness. Therefore the acquired character is inherited. It is undeniable and indisputable that the argument propounded by Prof. Lankester proves the inheritance of acquired characters, if it is properly applied in accordance with the facts. This is on the assumption that the \u201cold characters\u201d are acquired. If they are not acquired, the argument has no force at all. The facts allow us to say that the tendency to pigmentlessness, or the resistance to the development of pigment on the lower side of a flounder, is certainly inherited, but whether or not it is due to the absence of light during many successive generations we do not know. As Sir Edward Fry says, if we by definition confine the term \u201cacquired character\u201d within the limits of an individual history, then of course an acquired character can never be inherited. The question is whether the conditions which produce a change in the individual can affect the offspring? The experimental investigation must take the following course. Suppose a given amount of stimulation X to act upon individuals in successive generations, producing in the first generation a result x. Then the question is if X remains the same, does x remain constant or not? If there is no inherited effect, then x must remain constant in all succeeding generations. If x increases by some amount, however small, and becomes x + a, then a is not acquired by the individual, but inherited, and it is clear that the result will go on increasing to x + 2a, x + 3a, and so on to x + na, where n represents the number of generations. In my own opinion, there is evidence that something of this kind does occur, though definite investigations are much to be desired.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"51","prism.number":"1317","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"293","prism.endingPage":"294","prism.copyright":"1895 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/051293b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/051293b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/051293b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/051293b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"\u201cAcquired Characters\u201d","citation_volume":"51","citation_issue":"1317","citation_publication_date":"1895/01","citation_firstpage":"293","citation_lastpage":"294","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/051293b0","DOI":"10.1038/051293b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/051293b0","description":"IT would appear that Prof. Lankester has not thought it worth while to read all the letters that have appeared in NATURE on the question raised by Sir Edward Fry, unless it is to be inferred from his remarks that he confines himself to the consideration of the arguments of those who have a place on the scientific Olympus of the Royal Society. In my letter, published December 6, I defended Lamarck's laws against the accusation that they were reciprocally destructive. Prof. Lankester reiterates his accusation without any further support. But this is not the whole question. In his last letter he suggests that acquired characters corresponding to Mr. Galton's definition should be taken, and an investigation made as to whether they are inherited or not in later generations. But in his former letter (November 29) he suggested very distinctly and deliberately that such an investigation was unnecessary, because the question was already settled. He has already condemned the heretic, and now consents to his trial. His words were\u2014\u201cSince the old character had not become fixed and congenital after many thousands of successive generations of individuals had developed it in response to environment, but gave place to a new character when new conditions operated on an individual, why should we suppose that the new character is likely to become fixed after a much shorter time of responsive existence?\u201d To apply this once more to the case of pigment in relation to light. For thousands of generations no pigment has been developed, say, on the lower side of a flat fish, no light having fallen on it. The skin is experimentally exposed to light, and pigment appears: therefore the acquired character of absence of pigment, after thousands of generations, has produced no hereditary change, has not altered the potentialities of the tissue. The argument is fallacious, because the question of how much pigment is entirely ignored, and also the question how long the development of pigment experimentally takes. The force of the argument is entirely on the other side. Assume in this case, as Prof. Lankester does in his general argument, that the old character, the absence of pigment, is an acquired character. Then experiment has shown that this character is inherited: that is to say, the action of light obviously overcomes a resistance in producing pigment, and after years does not produce as much as on the upper side is present from the beginning. This resistance can be nothing else than heredity, the inheritance of a tendency to pigmentlessness. Therefore the acquired character is inherited. It is undeniable and indisputable that the argument propounded by Prof. Lankester proves the inheritance of acquired characters, if it is properly applied in accordance with the facts. This is on the assumption that the \u201cold characters\u201d are acquired. If they are not acquired, the argument has no force at all. The facts allow us to say that the tendency to pigmentlessness, or the resistance to the development of pigment on the lower side of a flounder, is certainly inherited, but whether or not it is due to the absence of light during many successive generations we do not know.

Suppose a given amount of stimulation X to act upon individuals in successive generations, producing in the first generation a result x. Then the question is if X remains the same, does x remain constant or not? If there is no inherited effect, then x must remain constant in all succeeding generations. If x increases by some amount, however small, and becomes x + a, then a is not acquired by the individual, but inherited, and it is clear that the result will go on increasing to x + 2a, x + 3a, and so on to x + na, where n represents the number of generations.

That paper was written soon after the Forest was taken over by the Corporation of London, when some unpleasant signs of artificial treatment had become manifest, and more especially with reference to certain railway schemes which, in the interest of naturalists, we of the Essex Field Club felt it our duty to oppose. It is a matter of ancient history that our opposition was successful. My object in entering the lists again is to assure your readers, as representing the scientific public, that the controversy which is now going on concerning the management of the Forest has nothing whatever to do with the agitation about the railway scheme of 1883. This statement may appear superfluous, but I am compelled to trespass upon your space because certain unscrupulous critics are in the habit of misleading the public by quoting from that paper published twelve years ago, without giving date or context, and without a single word of explanation as to its object. Moreover, the critics in question have endeavoured, by a method which in other controversial spheres would be called by a very strong name, to make it appear that some of the views put forward in 1883 are opposed to the attitude which, it is well known, I now hold in the present controversies. So far as naturalists are concerned, they may rest assured that, nothing that is now being done is in the way of injury to the Forest; far from this, there are signs of marked improvement. The policy of the Conservators is to restore the Forest to a natural condition by thinning out overcrowded pollards which are now beginning to injure one another, and to kill off the varied undergrowth which is such a relief to the gloomy barrenness of an unnaturally dense growth of trees. I may point out that the overcrowding is due to two opposite causes, viz. to entire neglect in some parts, and to too much attention in others. The latter cases refer to those parts in which in past times the rights of lopping were severely exercised. Here of course, now that the Conservators have extinguished these rights, the pollards are throwing up straight and lanky branches of a most unsightly character. In those very limited parts which were not formerly pollarded, and which consist of groves of spear trees, no attempt at systematic thinning had been made before the present Conservancy, and here also there is an overcrowding necessitating woodcraft. Within the last few years all that has been done has been done with care, skill, and fore thought. I rejoice to be able to bear testimony on this point, and to reassure those who may have been misled from a want of personal knowledge of the nature and history of the district, into giving credence to the intemperate correspondence in the news papers.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"52","prism.number":"1334","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"81","prism.endingPage":"81","prism.copyright":"1895 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/052081a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/052081a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/052081a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/052081a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Epping Forest: an Explanation","citation_volume":"52","citation_issue":"1334","citation_publication_date":"1895/05","citation_firstpage":"81","citation_lastpage":"81","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/052081a0","DOI":"10.1038/052081a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/052081a0","description":"SOME years ago you were good enough to publish a paper of mine, on the conservation of the Forest from the naturalists' point of view (vol. xxvii. p. 447). That paper was written soon after the Forest was taken over by the Corporation of London, when some unpleasant signs of artificial treatment had become manifest, and more especially with reference to certain railway schemes which, in the interest of naturalists, we of the Essex Field Club felt it our duty to oppose. It is a matter of ancient history that our opposition was successful.

It was then passing over the two small stars \u03bd and \u03be Urs\u00e6 Majoris, which at the time were at an altitude of 43\u00b0, azimuth 5\u00b0 north of east. Seeing that it meant to last awhile, I proceeded to repeat the alphabet in the orthodox manner (once through, each letter quickly but distinctly enunciated, requiring 4 seconds). Having gone over it twice, I must confess that my amazement at the meteor's duration made me pause. But it kept on, so I continued, getting through it twice more. Then, after a second involuntary but very unscientific pause, I finished the alphabet a fifth time before the phenomenon came to a close. In all, I must have watched it at least 25 seconds. After some 10 seconds, when about the same altitude as \u03b2 Leonis (24\u00b0), a smaller meteor (fourth magnitude) appeared 1\u00b0 to the left, at an angle of about 40\u00b0, and, proceeding at the same speed of under 2\u00b0 per second, lasted 3 or 4 seconds.

It was then passing over the two small stars \u03bd and \u03be Urs\u00e6 Majoris, which at the time were at an altitude of 43\u00b0, azimuth 5\u00b0 north of east. Seeing that it meant to last awhile, I proceeded to repeat the alphabet in the orthodox manner (once through, each letter quickly but distinctly enunciated, requiring 4 seconds). Having gone over it twice, I must confess that my amazement at the meteor's duration made me pause. But it kept on, so I continued, getting through it twice more. Then, after a second involuntary but very unscientific pause, I finished the alphabet a fifth time before the phenomenon came to a close. In all, I must have watched it at least 25 seconds. After some 10 seconds, when about the same altitude as \u03b2 Leonis (24\u00b0), a smaller meteor (fourth magnitude) appeared 1\u00b0 to the left, at an angle of about 40\u00b0, and, proceeding at the same speed of under 2\u00b0 per second, lasted 3 or 4 seconds. The original, of which this was doubtless a fragment, was between first and second magnitude, but with a distinct disc, and was followed by a train of sparks, reddish like itself, which was never more than 2\u00b0 or 3\u00b0 long, or lasting only 1 or 2 seconds. The fragment had also a slight train. The main mass seemed to pause slightly about this spot, perhaps because of this explosion. From the first it moved slower and slower, doubtless an effect of perspective, and finally disappeared almost due east (within 5\u00b0 north of east), only 5\u00b0 or so above the horizon, in the unusually clear sky just above the rising moon.","dc.creator":["CLARK, J.

The Kolis (fishing races) of the Bombay coast wore lately, and some still wear, knives made by local blacksmiths, of which the blade, 2 to 3 inches long, was shaped and edged like that of an English gardener's knife. There was no hilt, but a tang curved reversely to the blade, ending in a little curl. The whole figure was that of a manuscript capital S, with the lower curve heavily drawn and a fine finish at the top. Through the curl was passed a soft lanyard, and the whole worn round the neck, the knife hanging like a locket a little below the collar-bone. The way in which a man, holding the thin tang between the thumb and forefinger, or between two finger-knuckles, would cut anything, from a cable to a fish's head, was the more wonderful, as he would often prefer bringing his breast near the object to unslinging his knife. These knives are now passing out of use, displaced by old English and German clasp-knife blades, still without the hilts.

Flint flakes in Western India, from Sind to the Konkan, often show a curved inner edge with traces of use.

To use a term I have introduced elsewhere, the sport connotes a shifting of the focus of regression, but any normal variation, however improbable, does not. In the preface to the 1892 edition of his \u201cHereditary Genius,\u201d Mr. Galton writes: \u201cAll true variations are (as I maintain) of this kind [i.e. sports], and it is in consequence impossible that the natural qualities of a race may be permanently changed through the action of selection upon mere variations. The selection of the most serviceable variations cannot even produce any great degree of artificial and temporary improvement, because an equilibrium between deviation and regression will soon be reached, whereby the best of the offspring will cease to be better than their own sires and dams.\u201d And again: \u201cThe case is quite different in respect to what are technically known as \u2019sports.\u2019 In these a new character suddenly makes its appearance in a particular individual, causing him to differ distinctly from his parents and from others of his race.

Precisely this result was deduced by Prof. Hagen, of Berlin, in his most delicate experiments published by the Berlin Academy in 1874. His memoir is the first in Abbe's collection of translations, entitled \u201cThe Mechanics of the Earth's Atmosphere,\u201d and a detailed discussion of his results is given at pp. 234\u2013238 of his \u201cTreatise on Meteorological Apparatus and Methods.\u201d Hagen's results, when expressed in grams, decimetres and seconds, give the resistance per square decimetre as (0.00707 + 0.0001125 p) v2 where p is the contour of the plate and v the velocity. As his experiments were made with plates of only from 1 to 12 decimetres on a side, and as he showed that the size affects the coefficient quite as much as the shape, it would scarcely be proper to exterpolate from his small plates up to the large ones used by the French investigators. We should not expect any close agreement for a surface of one metre square between Hagen's figures and these newer ones, but the general law that the pressure per square unit depends upon both the size and the shape of the plate is due to Hagen. The explanation of this result is also largely due to him; it is not merely a question of gaseous viscosity or internal friction, but especially of that dissipation of energy that occurs in the ideal perfect fluid, and which has been called convective friction in the above-mentioned treatise and elsewhere. Le Dantec and Canovetti, by experimenting on a large scale, have necessarily encountered such irregularities and difficulties as must have limited the accuracy of their results quite as much as in the case of many other experiments since those of Sir Isaac Newton. In general, inasmuch as resistance per square unit varies with the size and shape of plane plates or other bodies, it can hardly be called an important physical constant of great scientific interest. It certainly has a practical interest to the aeronaut, the navigator, and the millwright, but the scientific interest of such experiments consist essentially in determining the lines of flow and the transformations of energy involved in the discontinuous motions.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"61","prism.number":"1576","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"248","prism.endingPage":"248","prism.copyright":"1900 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/061248a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/061248a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/061248a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/061248a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Resistance of the Air","citation_volume":"61","citation_issue":"1576","citation_publication_date":"1900/01","citation_firstpage":"248","citation_lastpage":"248","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/061248a0","DOI":"10.1038/061248a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/061248a0","description":"REFERRING to Mr. Bryan's summary, on page 107 of the current volume of NATURE, of the observations on the resistance of the air, made by Le Dantec and by Canovetti, it is but fair to say that the conclusion \u201cNo. 3,\u201d viz. that the resistance to a plane surface depends upon its contour, i.e. whether circular, square or triangular, is by no means new.

The largest spot seems to be drifting westwards, relatively to the zero meridian (System II.) of Mr. Crommelin's ephemerides, at the same rate as the S. temperate zone of Jupiter, viz. 16 degrees per month.

Nor is expectation lessened on the present occasion by the moderate though somewhat unexpected brilliance of the Leonid display witnessed last year in America on the morning of November 15. The question must naturally occur to many, will there be a revival of the phenomenon in the November of 1902, and if so, will it make its appearance in a less or a more intensified form than in the previous year? Generally speaking, the prospects of a star shower on the night of November 15 this year are very good. An analysis made by the writer of the conditions under which last year's shower appeared, and also of those connected with the more brilliant meteoric spectacles of the past, shows that the event of November 15, 1901, is likely to be much surpassed by the meteoric phenomenon of 1902.

Meteors from a radiant in full activity as it emerges above the horizon afford an interesting spectacle, however, and though their numbers must in consequence be seriously diminished, they somewhat atone for their paucity by often long and rapid flights across the heavens. This first appearance of the shower will of course be best observed in places situated at least a few hours to the east of Greenwich, though it ought not to escape observation in our less favoured localities. This early display promises to vie in brilliancy with that observed on the western slopes of the Pacific in 1901, if atmospheric conditions turn out favourable in those places best suited for its observation on the night of November 15, and in all places where the radiant will be above the horizon at the time of its maximum it ought to render shooting stars pretty abundant during the early hours of that night.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"67","prism.number":"1723","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"8","prism.endingPage":"8","prism.copyright":"1902 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/067008a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/067008a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/067008a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/067008a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Leonid Meteors, 1902.

They are a very rare shower, and even when considered by experienced observers as unusually abundant; they seldom appear at a higher rate than about twenty per hour. During the past century the Lyrids liave been subjected to pretty close observation. The star shower seen in America on the morning of April 20, 1803\u2014just 100 years ago\u2014seems to have far excelled in brilliancy its Lyrid successors, though a display witnessed, it is supposed, in 1860 in the equatorial regions, of Africa is described as having rivalled in splendour the November meteor-shower of 1866. Shooting stars were seen in unusual numbers in America on April 20, 1838, and Prof. Forshey observed a Lyrid display in Louisiana on the night of April 18, 1841, when he counted sixty meteors in 2\u00bd hours, which gives a mean rate of twenty-four per hour for one observer. On the morning of April 21, 1863, these meteors were reckoned by an English observer as appearing at the rate of forty per hour. On the night of April 18, 1876, a party of American students casually noticed that shooting stars were unusually numerous during the hours 10 to 12. Lyrid meteors were also conspicuous on the night of April 20, 1874. Mr. Denning has recorded important appearances of Lyrid meteors in 1882 and 1884, especially in the latter year on the night of April 19. The same observer has also stated that the Lyrid radiant was unusually active in 1893 and 1901, in the former on the nights of April 20 and 21, and in the latter on that of April 21. The foregoing are the most important displays on record since April 20, 1803. Periods of somewhat different lengths have been proposed with respect to the Lyrid showers, but the true period seems to be one which overlaps, and consists of nineteen years. Thus, from 1803 to 1860, we have exactly three periods of nineteen years, and from 1803 to 1841, two periods of the same length. Again, thirty-eight years, or twice nineteen years, separate the showers of 1838 and 1876. The nineteen-year period also connects the displays of 1863 and 1882, of 1874 and 1893, and of 1882 and 1901. This nineteen-year cycle is specially interesting, as it is completed at the Lyrid epoch of the present year, reckoning from the somewhat important display of April 19, 1884. A calculation made by the writer indicates that the maximum in 1903 is on April 19, 10h. 30m. G.M.T. The Lyrid radiant ought therefore to be found active in the early part of the night of April 19, probably from the hours 9 to 12.

I find that the proportions of red and green depend upon the luminosity of the match (both the mixed colour and the simple one being of similar luminosity); for instance, I require two and a half times as much green in the mixed colour when the match is bright compared with a match at a lower luminosity.

Recently an aluminium-leaf electroscope has been tested by me for insulation; the results, which speak for themselves, may be of interest to others who employ this electrical instrument.

Prof. Max Meyer does not base his views on experimental data; his paper is a purely theoretical discussion as to how the cochlea may act, if we make six fundamental assumptions, none of which can, at present at all events, be tested by direct examination or by direct experiment. His inquiry begins with the movements, in and out, of the stapes at the oval window. The tube filled owith fluid is divided into three compartments, the upper, the scala vestibuli, communicating at the apex of the cochlea with the scala tympani, at the foot of which we find the round window, while between the two scalae we have the cochlear duct, or scala intermedia, composed, in its turn, on one side by the basilar membrane, on which rests the organ of Corti, and on the other by Reissner's membrane. When the base of the stapes is pushed inwards at the base of the scala vestibuli, pressure is communicated to the fluid in the scala; (the scalae communicating at the apex of the cochlea by a little opening, the helicotrema), and the membrane of the round window passes outwardst towards the tympanic cavity. It is ogenerally held that with such pressure the fluid in the oscalse moves as a whole, and that pressure is communicated to the whole length of the scala intermedia, and especially to the basilar membrane, and that in this way the nerve-endings in Corti's organ are also submitted to pressure. The question then arises, is there any differentiating mechanism in the basilar membrane or in Corti's organ for tones of different frequencies, or, in other words, have we here an organ capable of analysis?

For this purpose I repeated the experiments with variations in the conditions. As the writer of the article seemed to think that the hot gases act in some way in cleaning the surface of the plate, the experiments were now made at lower temperatures. In place of the blow-pipe flame a Bunsen burner was used, and in order to protect part of the surface from the action of the hot gases, the plate was supported on two thick iron bars, so as to confine the action of the gases to the narrow space between them, and further, the glass plate was kept as cold as possible.

For this purpose I repeated the experiments with variations in the conditions. As the writer of the article seemed to think that the hot gases act in some way in cleaning the surface of the plate, the experiments were now made at lower temperatures. In place of the blow-pipe flame a Bunsen burner was used, and in order to protect part of the surface from the action of the hot gases, the plate was supported on two thick iron bars, so as to confine the action of the gases to the narrow space between them, and further, the glass plate was kept as cold as possible. It was intended to use ice for this purpose, but it was found that it kept the under surface always dewed, so that the gases could not come into contact, with the plate.

If Mr. Soddy only wishes to put forward a theory which is not inconsistent with the facts so far as they are known at present, I have nothing to say, but if he claims anything approaching to experimental proof, some critical comment may be forgiven.","dc.creator":["SCHUSTER, ARTHUR"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["SCHUSTER, ARTHUR"],"citation_author_institution":["Manchester"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Radio-elements and the Periodic Law","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Radio-elements and the Periodic Law&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"091109b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Here we report that natural oligomers of human A\u03b2 are formed soon after generation of the peptide within specific intracellular vesicles and are subsequently secreted from the cell. Cerebral microinjection of cell medium containing these oligomers and abundant A\u03b2 monomers but no amyloid fibrils markedly inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in rats in vivo. Immunodepletion from the medium of all A\u03b2 species completely abrogated this effect.

Here we report that natural oligomers of human A\u03b2 are formed soon after generation of the peptide within specific intracellular vesicles and are subsequently secreted from the cell. Cerebral microinjection of cell medium containing these oligomers and abundant A\u03b2 monomers but no amyloid fibrils markedly inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in rats in vivo. Immunodepletion from the medium of all A\u03b2 species completely abrogated this effect. Pretreatment of the medium with insulin-degrading enzyme, which degrades A\u03b2 monomers but not oligomers, did not prevent the inhibition of LTP. Therefore, A\u03b2 oligomers, in the absence of monomers and amyloid fibrils, disrupted synaptic plasticity in vivo at concentrations found in human brain and cerebrospinal fluid.

In the self-splicing group I intron from Tetrahymena thermophila2, several divalent metals can serve structural roles, but only Mg2+ and Mn2+ promote splice-site cleavage and exon ligation3,4. A study of a ribozyme reaction analogous to 5\u2032-splice-site cleavage by guanosine uncovered the first metal ion with a definitive role in catalysis. Substitution of the 3\u2032-oxygen of the leaving group with sulphur resulted in a metal-specificity switch, indicating an interaction between the leaving group and the metal ion5.

In the self-splicing group I intron from Tetrahymena thermophila2, several divalent metals can serve structural roles, but only Mg2+ and Mn2+ promote splice-site cleavage and exon ligation3,4. A study of a ribozyme reaction analogous to 5\u2032-splice-site cleavage by guanosine uncovered the first metal ion with a definitive role in catalysis. Substitution of the 3\u2032-oxygen of the leaving group with sulphur resulted in a metal-specificity switch, indicating an interaction between the leaving group and the metal ion5. Here we use 3\u2032-(thioinosylyl)-(3\u2032 \u2192 5\u2032)-uridine6, IspU, as a substrate in a reaction that emulates exon ligation.

A modelled increase to 750 parts per million by volume (p.p.m.v.) CO2 within 100 years (corresponding approximately to a continuation of today's growth rate) leads to a permanent shut-down of the thermohaline circulation. If the final atmospheric concentration of 750 p.p.m.v. CO2 is attained more slowly, the thermohaline circulation simply slows down. The reason for this rate-sensitive response of the climate system lies with the transfer of buoyancy in the form of heat and fresh water from the uppermost layers of the ocean into the deep waters below. This sensitivity of the simulated thermohaline circulation to the rate ofchange of atmospheric CO2 concentration has potentially important implications for the choice of future CO2-emission scenarios1.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"388","prism.number":"6645","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"862","prism.endingPage":"865","prism.copyright":"1997 Macmillan Magazines Ltd.","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/42224","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/42224","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/42224.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/42224","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Influence of CO2 emission rates on the stability of the thermohaline circulation","citation_volume":"388","citation_issue":"6645","citation_publication_date":"1997/08","citation_firstpage":"862","citation_lastpage":"865","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/42224","DOI":"10.1038/42224","citation_doi":"10.1038/42224","description":"Present estimates of the future oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 and calculations of CO2-emission scenarios1 are based on the assumption that the natural carbon cycle is in steady state.

A modelled increase to 750 parts per million by volume (p.p.m.v.) CO2 within 100 years (corresponding approximately to a continuation of today's growth rate) leads to a permanent shut-down of the thermohaline circulation. If the final atmospheric concentration of 750 p.p.m.v. CO2 is attained more slowly, the thermohaline circulation simply slows down. The reason for this rate-sensitive response of the climate system lies with the transfer of buoyancy in the form of heat and fresh water from the uppermost layers of the ocean into the deep waters below. This sensitivity of the simulated thermohaline circulation to the rate ofchange of atmospheric CO2 concentration has potentially important implications for the choice of future CO2-emission scenarios1.","dc.creator":["Stocker, Thomas F.","Schmittner, Andreas"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_title=Climate Change 1995: The Science of Climate Change; citation_publication_date=1996; citation_id=CR1; citation_author=JT Houghton","citation_title=Climate Processes and Climate Sensitivity; citation_publication_date=1984; citation_id=CR2; citation_author=H Oeschger","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=Does the ocean\u2013atmosphere system have more than one stable mode of operation?; citation_author=WS Broecker, D Peteet, D Rind; citation_volume=315; citation_publication_date=1985; citation_pages=21-25; citation_doi=10.1038/315021a0; citation_id=CR3","citation_title=The role of ocean-atmosphere reorganizations in glacial cycles.; citation_inbook_title=Geochim.

There are two basic body designs for jumping that enable many animals to escape from predators, to increase their speed of locomotion or to launch into flight1.

They may be remnants of earlier long, aerodynamic leg feathers, in keeping with the hypothesis that birds went through a four-winged stage during the evolution of flight1.","dc.creator":["Zhang, Fucheng","Zhou, Zhonghe"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_author=X Xu; citation_volume=421; citation_publication_date=2003; citation_pages=335-340; citation_doi=10.1038/nature01342; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_author=RO Prum; citation_volume=421; citation_publication_date=2003; citation_pages=323-324; citation_doi=10.1038/421323a; citation_id=CR2","citation_title=The Origin and Evolution of Birds; citation_publication_date=1999; citation_id=CR3; citation_author=A Feduccia","citation_journal_title=Comptes Rendus Palevol.; citation_author=P Christiansen, N Bonde; citation_volume=3; citation_publication_date=2004; citation_pages=99-118; citation_doi=10.1016/j.crpv.2003.12.001; citation_id=CR4","citation_title=Vertebrate Flight: Mechanics, Physiology, Morphology, Ecology and Evolution; citation_publication_date=1990; citation_id=CR5; citation_author=UM Norberg","citation_title=Animal Flight; citation_publication_date=1972; citation_id=CR6; citation_author=C Pennycuick","citation_title=The Beginnings of Birds; citation_publication_date=1985; citation_id=CR7; citation_author=R\u00c5 Norberg","citation_title=New Perspectives on the Origin and Early Evolution of Birds; citation_publication_date=2001; citation_id=CR8; citation_author=SM Gatesy","citation_journal_title=Biol.

This is one of the most intensively monitored seismically active regions, so here was a chance to test ideas on earthquake prediction. Danijel Schorlemmer and Stefan Wiemer of the Swiss Seismological Service analysed size distribution of micro-earthquakes in the decades before the main shock, and found that the data provide an accurate forecast of the eventual rupture area. This approach might improve hazard assessment on well monitored faults by predicting the location and size of events, but timing remains unpredictable.

This is one of the most intensively monitored seismically active regions, so here was a chance to test ideas on earthquake prediction. Danijel Schorlemmer and Stefan Wiemer of the Swiss Seismological Service analysed size distribution of micro-earthquakes in the decades before the main shock, and found that the data provide an accurate forecast of the eventual rupture area. This approach might improve hazard assessment on well monitored faults by predicting the location and size of events, but timing remains unpredictable.

Overexpression of the histone methyltransferase MMSET (WHSC1/NSD2), due to t(4;14) chromosomal translocation, promotes the proliferation of MM cells along with global changes in chromatin; nevertheless, the precise mechanisms by which MMSET stimulates neoplasia remain incompletely understood. We found that MMSET enhances the proliferation of MM cells by stimulating the expression of c-MYC at the post-transcriptional level. A microRNA (miRNA) profiling experiment in t(4;14) MM cells identified miR-126* as an MMSET-regulated miRNA predicted to target c-MYC mRNA.

Moreover, the expression of this miRNA was sufficient to decrease the proliferation rate of t(4;14) MM cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that MMSET binds to the miR-126* promoter along with the KAP1 corepressor and histone deacetylases, and is associated with heterochromatic modifications, characterized by increased trimethylation of H3K9 and decreased H3 acetylation, leading to miR-126* repression. Collectively, this study shows a novel mechanism that leads to increased c-MYC levels and enhanced proliferation of t(4;14) MM, and potentially other cancers with high MMSET expression.","prism.publicationName":"Leukemia","prism.publicationDate":"2012-09-13","prism.volume":"27","prism.number":"3","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"686","prism.endingPage":"694","prism.copyright":"2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/leu2012269","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/leu.2012.269","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/leu2012269.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/leu2012269","citation_journal_title":"Leukemia","citation_journal_abbrev":"Leukemia","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-5551","citation_title":"MMSET stimulates myeloma cell growth through microRNA-mediated modulation of c-MYC","citation_volume":"27","citation_issue":"3","citation_publication_date":"2013/03","citation_online_date":"2012/09/13","citation_firstpage":"686","citation_lastpage":"694","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/leu.2012.269","DOI":"10.1038/leu.2012.269","citation_doi":"10.1038/leu.2012.269","description":"Multiple myeloma (MM) represents the malignant proliferation of terminally differentiated B cells, which, in many cases, is associated with the maintenance of high levels of the oncoprotein c-MYC.

Among these, the polarization-division-multiplexing (PDM) scheme, which supports two independent data channels on a single wavelength with orthogonal polarization states, has become a standard one in most state-of-art telecommunication systems. Currently, however, only two polarization states (that is, PDM) can be used, setting a barrier for further SE improvement. Assisted by coherent detection and digital signal processing, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme for pseudo-PDM of four states (PPDM-4) by manipulation of four linearly polarized data channels with the same wavelength. Without any modification of the fiber link, we successfully transmit a 100-Gb\u2009s\u22121 PPDM-4 differential-phase-shift-keying signal over a 150-km single-mode fiber link. Such a method is expected to open new possibilities to fully explore the use of polarization freedom for capacity and SE improvement over existing fiber systems. A scheme for manipulating four linearly polarized data channels down existing fibre optic cables has been developed by researchers in China. Polarization-division multiplexing uses the polarization of light waves to differentiate multiple data streams travelling through a single-mode fibre.
