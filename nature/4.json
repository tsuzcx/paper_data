Most of his statements are incorrect, and, as an illustration of the trustworthiness of his facts, or supposed facts, allusion may be made to his remark that all he can find in the Cyclop\u00e6dia about Arvicol\u00e6, Crocidur\u00e6, Crossopi, Hypud\u00e6i, and Sorices is that Hypud\u00e6us is sometimes spelt Hipud\u00e6us is sometimes spelt Hipud\u00e6us; whereas all the species mentioned in the Close Time Report to which he refers are described or noticed in the Cyclop\u00e6dia. The species of the sub-genera Crocidura and Crossopus are referred to under their generic heading Sorex in the article Sorecid\u00e6, E. C. Some of the terms which he says are omitted properly belong to another division of the Cyclop\u00e6dia. Thus Acclimatisation is noticed in the Arts and Sciences division, and something additional will probably be given in the supplement to that division. Again, Deep Sea Dredging had scarcely become a subject of general interest when the Natural History Supplement was being written, while the character of the principal results, and the probability of great additions to the subject, rendered it advisable, as was thought, to postpone its consideration until the Arts and Sciences division was supplemented. Some of the results are, however, given under Alcyonaria and elsewhere in the Natural History Supplement. As regards the other subjects said to be omitted, most of them do occur. Darwinism is noticed under Species, E. C. S., and also under Pal\u00e6ontology, Crustacea, &c. Dimorphism in Animals will be found under Annelida, Hydrozoa, Generations (Alternation of), Crustacea, &c., in E. C. S. Eophyton is noticed; and Eozoon is repeatedly mentioned, while its systematic position is described under Foraminifera. The article Entophyta in E. C. is devoted to the fungi connected with skin diseases, while those which are associated with ague and other diseases would be most appropriately noticed in connection with those diseases, which do not belong to the Natural History division. A whole column is given to Hyalonema under Alcyonaria, E. C. S., in which the contradictory views of Drs. Bowerbank, Gray, Wright, and others, are distinctly referred to. Something is said about Hybridity under Primula. Ornithoscelida is not in; the term was first proposed in a paper read Nov. 24, 1869, which paper was not published in the printed form until after the Supplement had been finished. The general views on Protoplasm are given under Cells, Am\u00e6ba, and so far as it is identical with Sarcode under Actinophrys, Sarcode, and other headings in E.C.S. Rhizocrinus is referred to under London Clay, and its occurrence in the living state mentioned. Aerolites: The latest reference is said to be 1861, implying, as it seems, that none of the information is of later date. Falls subsequent to 1861 are mentioned, and many of the facts are of later date; as, for example, those relating to the Alais and Orgeuil aerolites; Sorby's conclusions published in 1865; and Daubr\u00e9e's experiments, of which accounts were given in 1866 and 1868. The article itself appeared early in 1869. As to the bibliography, the principal authors are mentioned, and a list of the works consulted was written, but was inadvertently omitted. It is also said that the latest reference under Alca is 1861, but this again is not correct. The writer of the article Annelida was not aware of Clapar\u00e8de's strictures at the time he wrote it; but, after all, they do not seem to affect materially the general statements given in the supplementary volume. Prof. Huxley's views respecting the systematic position of Arch\u00e6opteryx are given under Birds, E.C.S. No reference is made to Protagon under Blood, E.C.S., nor is mention made of Day's colour tests, nor Dr. Richardson's renunciation. Of the last, all that was found in the Reports of the British Association is the title of his paper, which runs thus, \u201cOn Coagulation of the Blood; a correction of the Ammonia theory,\u201d and of which nothing more is said. Hence it was thought best to say nothing about the matter. Of the long string of terms which \u201cNemo\u201d has culled from Prof. Huxley's last address to the Geological Society, and which are said to be omitted, the majority are given in the Supplement. For instance, to cite one or two cases: Anthracosaurus occurs under Carboniferous system, E.C.S.; Evolution under Pal\u00e6ontology; Micrslestes under Rh\u00e6tic Beds; and so on. As to the other remarks which have not been specially alluded to, it may be admitted that some of the articles might have been improved. Foraminifera would have been all the better if Haeckel's volume had been consulted, only Haeckel's work could not be got. It would have been very desirable if subjects which have been omitted had been inserted, and if cross references had been more numerous; but there were restrictions as to space which rendered it necessary to make a selection. Thus, Meloe was inserted and Sphegid\u00e6 rejected, because there was no room for both. What a Cyclop\u00e6dia ought or ought not to contain is an open question. It cannot give information upon everything; and probably very few persons not specially interested in the subject want to know about Hy\u00e6nictis or Ictitherium. If regard was had to the theoretical view of the matter, and not to the cost and other practical drawbacks, a full, account of all that has been done in the last sixteen years would fill several volumes as large as the Supplement to the \u201cNatural History Division of the English Cyclop\u00e6dia.\u201d I beg to sign myself","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"2","prism.number":"36","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"187","prism.endingPage":"188","prism.copyright":"1870 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/002187d0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/002187d0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/002187d0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/002187d0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The \u201cEnglish Cyclop\u00e6dia\u201d","citation_volume":"2","citation_issue":"36","citation_publication_date":"1870/07","citation_firstpage":"187","citation_lastpage":"188","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/002187d0","DOI":"10.1038/002187d0","citation_doi":"10.1038/002187d0","description":"YOUR issue of June 2 contains a long letter from \u201cNemo,\u201d to which a short reply seems desirable.

Government is becoming more and more alive to the fact that Education and Science at the present are England's greatest needs; hence the steps taken to extend and enforce primary education. But whilst increased facilities are being afforded to raise the standard of primary education, secondary education is at a stand-still, and upon the whole falls far short of the point it should reach. Thousands of our middle-class schools when compared with what is required, may be placed in the same category as the old dame's school when compared with the modern national school. It requires but the slightest knowledge of the subject to know that our middle-class educational system is as a whole a mere farce, and yet so averse are we to change, that matters are allowed to go on year after year in the same old matter-of-course style without the slightest indication of reform.

Government is becoming more and more alive to the fact that Education and Science at the present are England's greatest needs; hence the steps taken to extend and enforce primary education. But whilst increased facilities are being afforded to raise the standard of primary education, secondary education is at a stand-still, and upon the whole falls far short of the point it should reach. Thousands of our middle-class schools when compared with what is required, may be placed in the same category as the old dame's school when compared with the modern national school. It requires but the slightest knowledge of the subject to know that our middle-class educational system is as a whole a mere farce, and yet so averse are we to change, that matters are allowed to go on year after year in the same old matter-of-course style without the slightest indication of reform. In order to encroach upon your space as little as possible, I will in a succinct and concise form lay before your readers a scheme which has been lately mooted, which has received the sanction of the highest authorities in these matters, and which is destined ultimately to bring about quite a new system.

In the spectrum, we have the maximum of light in the yellow, and it is against our experience to put two dark colours together and form one light one, as, for example, to put the red and green together and form yellow. But there is just the same difficulty in the production of white light from all the colours of the spectrum, for we regard white as lighter than any of the colours, even than yellow. This, however, is a mental fallacy, and if once exposed, seems to me to do away with the difficulty of conceiving white as made up of a series of colours. Our ideas of colours and tints are derived from our own experience, and we produce tints by precisely the opposite method to that of nature. Nature's method of painting a blade of grass is, to throw on it all the colours of the spectrum, and afterwards pick out those which shall have a residue of green. The artist's method is to see what colours will produce green and then lay those on. I do not think it too much to say that all colours are merely tints of white\u2014that, for example, yellow is really yellowish white, green, greenish white, and so on. If we take two cards, one green, the other red, and hold them so that the light is properly reflected from the one on to the other, the cards do not appear black but white. If the red and green were pure colours, the cards should of course appear black, for the light from the green card would be totally absorbed by the red card, and similarly with the red card.

In the spectrum, we have the maximum of light in the yellow, and it is against our experience to put two dark colours together and form one light one, as, for example, to put the red and green together and form yellow. But there is just the same difficulty in the production of white light from all the colours of the spectrum, for we regard white as lighter than any of the colours, even than yellow. This, however, is a mental fallacy, and if once exposed, seems to me to do away with the difficulty of conceiving white as made up of a series of colours. Our ideas of colours and tints are derived from our own experience, and we produce tints by precisely the opposite method to that of nature. Nature's method of painting a blade of grass is, to throw on it all the colours of the spectrum, and afterwards pick out those which shall have a residue of green. The artist's method is to see what colours will produce green and then lay those on. I do not think it too much to say that all colours are merely tints of white\u2014that, for example, yellow is really yellowish white, green, greenish white, and so on. If we take two cards, one green, the other red, and hold them so that the light is properly reflected from the one on to the other, the cards do not appear black but white. If the red and green were pure colours, the cards should of course appear black, for the light from the green card would be totally absorbed by the red card, and similarly with the red card. The white cannot be produced by a combination of the red and green, but by the extinction on one card of the green that gives the greenish white, and on the other of the red which gives the reddish white. That yellow is but little different from white is well illustrated in the beautiful experiment of Newton's of synthesising the colours of the spectrum by reflection from seven moveable mirrors. With the mirrors placed at equal distances from each other, the spot of compound light is not white but yellow, that is to say, it is yellowish white, the colours lost between the mirrors being just those necessary to bring out the full white.","dc.creator":["WOODWARD, C.

Nevertheless enough of it was seen to produce a very striking impression. It began to tinge the southern sky at a considerable altitude so early in the evening that I thought it must have been the reflection of a crimson sunset; nor was I undeceived till I had been to the other side of the house, where I found the western horizon glowing with amber light, in which was no trace of the expected ruddiness. Red continued throughout to be the prevailing hue, chiefly in great diffused masses, but occasionally broken up into filaments and streamers; there was, however, no absence of sheets and columns of the more usual pale green light. The clouds, chiefly heavy cumuli, assumed a strange aspect; sometimes, when opposite to the crimson illumination, reflecting a dull and sombre red, at others, when projected in front of it and enlightened from the other side by the twilight, or the green aurora, standing out inllurid and ghastly contrast. At one period the northern part of the sky, up to a great altitude, though clear and studded with stars, appeared at first sight almost like a black cloud from its contrast to the greenish white sheet which bordered it abruptly at a considerable height on the west; this again passing into crimson masses in the south, and sending out a whitish stream to meet another from the east, and form, probably, for a few moments, a complete bright ring, somewhat south of the zenith, of which, however, only one half could be seen from the post of observation. The light was so intense that even after it had been a good deal obscured by cloud, a large print might have been read without much difficulty, A miniature spectroscope (one of Browning's) brought out some interesting features. The usual yellowish green auroral line was distinct everywhere, and could be perceived even when the instrument was directed to masses of dense cloud; and as was observed by Birmingham on a former occasion, could be made out in the reflection from any suitable terrestrial object; white paper for example exhibited it very obviously. As shown in the brighter greenish patches in the sky, it remained visible even when the slit was so much contracted that the sodium band of a common fire would have been thinned down almost to its smallest breadth before extinction. Such a diminution of light, however, was fatal to the rest of the spectrum, which was a very remarkable one. With a wider slit a crimson band, bearing a fair amount of contraction, was perceptible in the brighter patches of that hue, with a dark interval between it and the principal green band. On the opposite side of that green band, beyond a second similar dark space, was a considerable extent of greenish or bluish light, quite decided, but so feeble as to leave it undecided whether it was of uniform brightness, or (as I suspected) compounded of contiguous bands; beyond this again was another dark space, leading on to a faintly luminous band, too dim to show colour, but which must have taken its place somewhere in the blue. This band, and the darkness adjacent to it on the less refrangible side, were each about as broad as the intensely vivid yellowish green stripe. Could the light have borne sufficient reduction, we should certainly have had three narrow bright bands in the red, green, and blue, the two latter being wide apart, with either a faint separate continuous spectrum, through part of the interval, or possibly several feeble lines, which the widening of the slit fused into one lengthened area.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"5","prism.number":"120","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"303","prism.endingPage":"303","prism.copyright":"1872 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/005303a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/005303a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/005303a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/005303a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Aurora of February 4","citation_volume":"5","citation_issue":"120","citation_publication_date":"1872/02","citation_firstpage":"303","citation_lastpage":"303","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/005303a0","DOI":"10.1038/005303a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/005303a0","description":"A VIEW of the magnificent aurora of Feb. 4 was much interrupted here by great masses of cloud, which frequently drifted over large tracts of the illuminated sky, and towards 8 o'clock collected and descended in a general downpour of rain.

A special kind of Bunsen burner was made with a spiral mixing tube coiled in an inverted cup, at the centre of which is a small chamber covered with wire-gauze at the foot of a short tube or flame-pipe. The gas is admitted by a single jet passing through a cap of wire-gauze covering the conical opening of the spiral tube, the object of this cap of gauze being to distribute the air in its approach, and to protect the gas-jet from ignition. The gas-flame burns with a small bright green cone, surmounted by a larger envelope of pale reddish flame, and it is intensely hot. The green cone indicates combustion of the most complete explosive mixture of air and coal-gas, and when the burner is properly adjusted it can only burn on the top of the flame-tube, where it finds the additional required supply of oxygen; but it descends to the wire-gauze at the foot of the tube if the air-supply exceeds, or the gas supply falls short of the right proportion. In some of these burners the slightest noise of the kind that commonly affects sensitive flames causes the cone of green flame to retreat into the tube and settle on the wire-gauze at its foot, whence it rises again immediately to the top of the tube, when the sound ceases. The explanation seems to be that the air-current entering the mixing-tube through the outer gauze cap is in a sensitive condition, and that when thrown into disturbance by the external sounds, it is more quickly seized and is drawn into the mixing tube more rapidly by the gas-jet than when it is flowing over the jet in a tranquil state. The inventor of these burners, Mr. Wallace, assures me that some of them exhibit the most sensitive of sensitive flames, and that he has more than once thought of sending one of them as a most singularly effective illustration of such flames to Prof. Tyndall.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"11","prism.number":"264","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"45","prism.endingPage":"47","prism.copyright":"1874 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/011045a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/011045a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/011045a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/011045a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Sounding and Sensitive Flames* II.","citation_volume":"11","citation_issue":"264","citation_publication_date":"1874/11","citation_firstpage":"45","citation_lastpage":"47","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/011045a0","DOI":"10.1038/011045a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/011045a0","description":"ANOTHER example of a highly sensitive flame was recently described to me which seems to show that air-currents flowing through gauze at a proper speed are sensitive without the intervention or simultaneous superaddition of a flame. A special kind of Bunsen burner was made with a spiral mixing tube coiled in an inverted cup, at the centre of which is a small chamber covered with wire-gauze at the foot of a short tube or flame-pipe. The gas is admitted by a single jet passing through a cap of wire-gauze covering the conical opening of the spiral tube, the object of this cap of gauze being to distribute the air in its approach, and to protect the gas-jet from ignition. The gas-flame burns with a small bright green cone, surmounted by a larger envelope of pale reddish flame, and it is intensely hot.

The birds force their long bills into the wet sand as far as the nostrils, and then again withdraw it, leaving a small hole, which, when probed, is found to be only just large enough to have taken in the bill. The animal, therefore, can only have made a single prolonged push without adding any lateral or exploring movements of the bill, as birds which feed in mud may be observed to do. Now it cannot be supposed that curlews adopt this mode of feeding without obtaining from it some degree of profit. Neither can it be supposed that they make their thrusts into the sand at random; for, their bills being so pointed and slender, the birds would usually require to make a vast number of ineffectual thrusts before they happened to hit upon a worm or other edible object. The question therefore is, How do the birds know the precise spots where their victims lie buried in the sand? That this knowledge is not derived by sight I am quite sure, for I have repeatedly observed innumerable curlew marks of the kind described occurring on tracts of sand which, in virtue of their high level, presented a perfectly smooth and uniform surface. I can therefore only suppose that the birds are guided in their probings by their sense of hearing. Doubtless it is difficult to believe that this sense is so delicate and precise as to enable the curlew to perceive so exceedingly slight a sound as that which must be caused by the movement, say, of a small worm at a distance of ten or twelve inches from the surface of the sand, and at the same time to localise the exact spot beneath the surface from which so slight a sound proceeds. I cannot see, however, that any other explanation is open, and perhaps the one now offered may not seem so incredible if we remember the case of the thrush. No one, I think, can observe this bird feeding and doubt that it finds its worms and grubs almost exclusively by the sense of hearing.

I have shot many thousands of Australian duck, and towering has occurred among them pretty frequently. In one case, the notes of which I have, the duck began to rise almost immediately, and rose to a great height.

It does exist in Queensland, but how far north it is impossible to decide until we are better acquainted with that extensive territory. The fact of one having been found by Mr. Kennedy, as mentioned by Mr. Forbes at Plain Creek in lat. 21\u00b0 S. is, as far as the published statement can be depended upon, correct, and was never considered by any Australian in Queensland as a matter of doubt, as they were well acquainted with the animal; but whether the Tachyglossus was the same or of a different species I do not consider has been sufficiently noticed; whether it was the Tachyglossus hystrix, or with sufficient distinctive characters, as has been recently found in that ot New Guinea to make it a new species, is not known, as ordinary travellers are not able to distinguish those characteristic differences which would immediately strike the experienced naturalist. The species found in the vicinity of Darling Downs, &c., is evidently the Tachyglossus hystrix, and from a recent letter received from my son, Mr. G. F. Bennett, he finds no difficulty in procuring specimens of this species near Foowoomba by offering rewards for those procured at certain intervals of time, to enable him to carry out his investigations on the mode of generation of the Monotremata, and if possible to procure the impregnated uterus of that animal, as well as that of the Ornithorhynchus, as in both animals it no doubt will be identical. As far as regards the rudimental pouch in the Echidna it is only able to be found in that animal during the breeding season, and I could never detect it at any other time. It is mentioned by Prof. Owen in his memoir on the young of the Echidna (Philosophical Transactions, 1865, p. 678), and indeed it has been a well-known fact for some period of time, as some years ago I doubted the assertion and public attention was most particularly drawn to it, and the fact was ascertained beyond doubt even before the publication of Prof. Owen's paper.

It does exist in Queensland, but how far north it is impossible to decide until we are better acquainted with that extensive territory. The fact of one having been found by Mr. Kennedy, as mentioned by Mr. Forbes at Plain Creek in lat. 21\u00b0 S. is, as far as the published statement can be depended upon, correct, and was never considered by any Australian in Queensland as a matter of doubt, as they were well acquainted with the animal; but whether the Tachyglossus was the same or of a different species I do not consider has been sufficiently noticed; whether it was the Tachyglossus hystrix, or with sufficient distinctive characters, as has been recently found in that ot New Guinea to make it a new species, is not known, as ordinary travellers are not able to distinguish those characteristic differences which would immediately strike the experienced naturalist. The species found in the vicinity of Darling Downs, &c., is evidently the Tachyglossus hystrix, and from a recent letter received from my son, Mr. G. F. Bennett, he finds no difficulty in procuring specimens of this species near Foowoomba by offering rewards for those procured at certain intervals of time, to enable him to carry out his investigations on the mode of generation of the Monotremata, and if possible to procure the impregnated uterus of that animal, as well as that of the Ornithorhynchus, as in both animals it no doubt will be identical. As far as regards the rudimental pouch in the Echidna it is only able to be found in that animal during the breeding season, and I could never detect it at any other time. It is mentioned by Prof. Owen in his memoir on the young of the Echidna (Philosophical Transactions, 1865, p. 678), and indeed it has been a well-known fact for some period of time, as some years ago I doubted the assertion and public attention was most particularly drawn to it, and the fact was ascertained beyond doubt even before the publication of Prof. Owen's paper. The Ornithorhynchus being an aquatic animal does not possess a pouch at any time. With respect to the New Guinea species of Echidna the question whether the Tachyglossus lawsei and T. bruijmi are distinct species can now be decided, as I observe that examples of both sexes of T. bruijnii have been obtained in the mountains on the north coast of New Guinea at an elevation of about 3,500 feet.

This will sufficiently explain the behaviour of J. C.'s moths (NATURE, vol. xvii. p. 45), and my own larv\u00e6 (NATURE, vol xvil p. 102).

SEARLES V. WOOD will, I trust, pardon me if I again take exception to the terms in which (supr\u00e0, p. 301) he still writes of Didus and Didunculus. These two birds do not belong to the same group of Columb\u00e6. The fact that certain authors may have included them under the designation of \u201cground-doves\u201d is no proof whatever of their relationship, any more than it is of the relationship of either to any other birds so called\u2014for instance those of the Neotropical genus Cham\u00e6pelia.

During the \u00beh. of observation 15 shooting-stars were counted, of which 4 or 5 only belonged to the shower of Lyrids. These were faint and somewhat slow, with slight trains and short paths. The radiant point could not be exactly fixed. Of the other meteors three were brilliant (2 = 1st mag. and 1 = 2nd mag.), and moved with extreme swiftness from a radiant point at 286\u00b0 + 23\u00b0. They left bright greenish streak, and were readily distinguished from the Lyrids, though the radiants lie near together. This new shower near \u03b2 Cygni (Albireo) appears to form an important display at this epoch.

During the \u00beh. of observation 15 shooting-stars were counted, of which 4 or 5 only belonged to the shower of Lyrids. These were faint and somewhat slow, with slight trains and short paths. The radiant point could not be exactly fixed. Of the other meteors three were brilliant (2 = 1st mag. and 1 = 2nd mag.), and moved with extreme swiftness from a radiant point at 286\u00b0 + 23\u00b0. They left bright greenish streak, and were readily distinguished from the Lyrids, though the radiants lie near together. This new shower near \u03b2 Cygni (Albireo) appears to form an important display at this epoch.

The tree is indigenous to the West Indies and to South America.","dc.creator":["CHAPPELL, WM."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["CHAPPELL, WM."],"citation_author_institution":["Weybridge"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Protection against Mosquitos, Flies, and Blight","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Protection against Mosquitos, Flies, and Blight&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"022077d0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The instinct of self-destruction in moths must be older than the introduction of artificial light, and cannot be of use exclusively to collectors, but though its benefits to salmon and trout are obvious enough, its advantages to the moths are not so apparent, unless this selfdevotion checks an increase that otherwise would be disadvantageous.","dc.creator":["GARDNER, J.

At 9 p.m. the centre of energy was in the north-west, and from a large blunted cone-shaped smoke-like luminous mass in that quarter, fan-rayed streamers were projected to the zenith. The streamers were crossed at equal intervals by horizontal bars, similar in appearance, minus the motion, to the pulsating bars which sometimes form a feature of auroral activity. The day had been finer than has been the prevalent weather of late. Set of wind during the day, north-west. Drift of the clouds at high altitudes from south-west. The night calm, barometer high, thermometer 57. At 9 p.m. the western sky was covered with flocculent cirri. The north-west was obscured by the dense eruptive volume of auroral vapour. The northern sky was clear, and so was the eastern. The moon was shining brightly. The line between the auroral mass and the region of blue sky was remarkably sharp and well defined. Just after 10 p. m. a narrow streamer of great brilliancy shot from the north-west across the zenith to the north-western limb of the moon, constituting a notable feature of the display. As the night wore on, the centre of energy, together with the basal eruptive mass, travelled slowly north-wards, and the northern sky became covered with bright white beams, rays, and streamers. At the same time, clouds of the cirrus type made a mackerel sky in the west, as well as in the zenith towards the south. Some of the streamers were of extreme tenuity, others were dense and bright, hiding the stars over which they passed. The sky in the end was covered with a light haze, which condensed into a cloud canopy. No prismatic colours were visible, streamers, beams, and rays throughout being alike of a pure white light, though greatly luminous, so as to retain distinctive individuality in the face of brilliant moonlight. Thursday, early morn, sun shining through a hazy sky, wind light from the south; 9 a.m., overcast; 11 a.m., rainfall set in. Continuous all the day. Sharp fall of barometer. Thermometer mid-day, 65, wind inclined to back to the eastward. Considering that the vernal and autumnal equinoxes are the usual periods of auroral activity, and that there is yet a month to the 21st of September, an instance, now of auroral energy is somewhat out of the usual course of things. The equinoctial gales, yet earlier, set in with much rigour. Perhaps, as everything has a meaning, these phenomena presage the kind of weather which is to rule the autumn. Scarcely a summer bird remains save the swallow and martin. The swift left early. A solitary bird or a pair was observed, however, evening by evening up to the 28th to return to the nesting place of the tribe, as loth to leave the English home. To day (Friday) continuous rain, which has prevailed all the night.

My attention was first called to the peculiar likeness by my friend, Dr. V. T. McGillicuddy, who had in his possession a couple of owlets nearly as large as the adults. The capture of a number of both snakes and birds enabled me by experiment to determine to what extent one might be deceived by the resemblance. At the distance of a few feet the shrill tremulous scream would deceive persons quite familiar with the sound of the rattling of the Crotalus. When not noticing or thinking of the birds, their cry produced on us the same effect as the sudden springing of the rattle by an angry snake. The experiments left no doubt that the cries produced a similar effect on other animals which unwittingly disturbed young owls. And in this way they led to a consideration of the possible benefit of this close resemblance, or, as it might be called by some, mimicry. As you know, the birds are fond of the deserted holes of different burrowing animals, especially so of those of various Spermophiles or Prairie Squirrels. They are common in and about colonies of the so called \u201cPrairie Dogs\u201d (cynomys ludovicianus), where they take possession of vacant burrows, and sometimes even of those in use, sooner or later dispossessing the rightful owners, as the dogs seem disinclined to bring eyes and noses into contact with the sharp beaks and claws in the passages however familiar they may be with the birds around the mouths of the dwellings.

May it not be that the peculiar protest or scream of the young owl, by its resemblance to the danger. signal, insures safety by preventing the approach of the mammals, and, possibly, of the dull-eared snakes themselves? The scream of the old bird is rather more hoarse and somewhat less like the shrilling of the serpent. On ordinary occasions, the note of this owl is a cackling or chuckling chatter or laugh, varied with what seem very much like imitations of the barking and squealing of the squirrels. When caught, it gives utterance to the hoarse, long-drawn, rattling scream. The owlets ate greedily of fresh meat, stopping to utter their strange cry of alarm at every attempt to approach them.

Chuckling to himself, down into the darkness be plunged, and that was the last we saw of him.","dc.creator":["GARMAN, S."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["GARMAN, S."],"citation_author_institution":["Cambridge, U.S.A."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Scream of the Young Burrowing Owl Sounds...","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Scream of the Young Burrowing Owl Sounds like the Warning of the...","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"027241a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Is is very apparent in the cracks throughout Dr. Green's house, which take a complete screw round some of the rooms and the staircase. It is also evident in the twist of the tapering mill chimney shaft where the upper 20 feet (still standing) is screwed round at the fracture upon the lower part about one inch.

The angle of fracture is about 47\u00b0 to the horizon, and it appears to me that this must have been the direction of the first or greater shock in this district, which was therefore more one of upheaval than of horizontal motion.

The heaviest showers\u2014called by all who were out in them \u201cshowers of mud\u201d\u2014occurred at 7 o'clock p.m. and near midnight. The leaves of trees and shrubs, roofs of buildings, fences, and everything on which it could rest were more or less covered with red mud. The weather at Sandhurst for some ten days prior to this occurrence had been dry, and for a long period there had been a drought in New South Wales and in many parts northward. At several places in Victoria and New South Wales violent dust-storms occurred on the morning of the 24th immediately preceding the commencement of the rain. Some of the mud, of a bronze colour, collected by Mr. Edward Hurst of Sandhurst, was found by microscopical and chemical examination to be composed of quartz, oxide of iron, and mica; some taken from the rain-gauge stand at the School of Mines was, when dried, an almost impalpable powder of a pale reddish chocolate colour. It was seen to consist of ferruginous quartz and minute particles of black oxide of iron; and a smaller quantity collected at my private meteorological observatory\u2014about three-quarters of a mile distant\u2014was paler in colour, and consisted of quartz (much of it iron-free), alumina, sesquioxide of iron, and white and reddish-yellow mica. A small proportion of it was attractable by the magnet.

The heaviest showers\u2014called by all who were out in them \u201cshowers of mud\u201d\u2014occurred at 7 o'clock p.m. and near midnight. The leaves of trees and shrubs, roofs of buildings, fences, and everything on which it could rest were more or less covered with red mud. The weather at Sandhurst for some ten days prior to this occurrence had been dry, and for a long period there had been a drought in New South Wales and in many parts northward. At several places in Victoria and New South Wales violent dust-storms occurred on the morning of the 24th immediately preceding the commencement of the rain. Some of the mud, of a bronze colour, collected by Mr. Edward Hurst of Sandhurst, was found by microscopical and chemical examination to be composed of quartz, oxide of iron, and mica; some taken from the rain-gauge stand at the School of Mines was, when dried, an almost impalpable powder of a pale reddish chocolate colour. It was seen to consist of ferruginous quartz and minute particles of black oxide of iron; and a smaller quantity collected at my private meteorological observatory\u2014about three-quarters of a mile distant\u2014was paler in colour, and consisted of quartz (much of it iron-free), alumina, sesquioxide of iron, and white and reddish-yellow mica. A small proportion of it was attractable by the magnet. The water collected in the rain-gauges when agitated was reddish-brown in colour, and the proportion of sediment was very large, leaving no room for doubt that the dust was brought down by the rain. Its composition and the times at which it fell lead me to believe that it came from the north and had travelled far.","dc.creator":["SMYTH, R.

There was a copious deposit of hoar-frost upon the grass, upon the upper side of wooden rails, and upon the topmost twigs of the bushes in the tall hedges (6 to 8 feet high), but the lower twigs in the hedges had little or none. On stones in the road, as Mr. Aitken observes, there was little hoar-frost on the upper surface, only lines of ice crystals along the salient angles, but their under surfaces were thickly covered. With the loose heaps of broken stones by the road-sides the case was different: here the uppermost stones were thickly coated with frost on their upper surface, but had little on their lower surface; the stones underneath the uppermost layer, on the contrary, were coated with hoarfrost on their under, but not on their upper, surfaces.

A large hollow iron roller, 24 inches in diameter, had a copious crop of ice crystals on the upper surface, but little on the sides.

In the spring of 1886, I captured a small gecko (Tarantola mauritanica) at Rome, and I have hitherto succeeded in keeping it alive and in health. One of the first things I noticed about it was the extraordinary vigour with which so small an animal would bite one's finger. And the effect produced was certainly rather due to the lizard's expression of intense ferocity during the process than to the pinch which it was able to give. The expression chiefly depends upon two things\u2014the fact that the anterior part of the head may be bent downwards, and that the eyes are retracted into the head. Examining the former movement more carefully, it was seen that in opening the mouth the upper jaw is distinctly although slightly raised above the normal, so that the profile of the upper surface of the head becomes almost straight (compare Figs. 1 and 2). In biting fiercely it is common for the upper jaw to be depressed below the normal, as is plainly seen in a profile view (compare Fig. 3), although in other positions the curvature of the head is normal, and again in others the profile may remain straight in biting (as in Fig. 2). As far as I could observe in Tarantola, the upper jaw was always raised in opening the mouth, and the profile of the head straightened from its normal curve when at rest, but on closing the mouth in biting the movement of the upper jaw depended upon the relative position of the animal to the object which it was biting. This depression of the upper jaw may be also often witnessed when the mouth is closed, and it may be produced by applying slight pressure to the head. The animal seems to make the most of its powers of expression, for on provocation it opens its relatively huge mouth with the greatest readiness, and will keep it open for a considerable time, during which its appearance is sufficiently awe-inspiring. The fact that the anterior part of the skull is not co-ossified with the posterior part is well known. Thus in Huxley's \u201cAnatomy of Vertebrata\u201d (1871, p. 225) the following statement is made concerning the geckos: \u201cNeither the upper nor the lower temporal arcades are ossified, the post-frontal being connected with the squamosal and the maxilla with the quadrateby ligament;\u201d and Mr. Boulenger informs me that had he been asked whether the upper jaw of such lizards is moved in biting, he would have been inclined to answer in the affirmative, reasoning from the well-known condition of the skull. But I believe it has not been hitherto actually observed that such movable articulations possess a functional value in the living animal, and that the geckos must be added to the well-known instance of the parrots as Vertebrata which move the upper jaw in biting. It is extremely probable that the same observations will be found to hold for other families of lizards.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"35","prism.number":"909","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"511","prism.endingPage":"512","prism.copyright":"1887 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/035511b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/035511b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/035511b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/035511b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"\"The Gecko moves its Upper Jaw\"","citation_volume":"35","citation_issue":"909","citation_publication_date":"1887/03","citation_firstpage":"511","citation_lastpage":"512","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/035511b0","DOI":"10.1038/035511b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/035511b0","description":"THUS by the substitution of one reptile for another\u2014of the gecko for the crocodile\u2014the well-remembered zoological statement in Arnold's Greek prose is at length put upon a satisfactory foundation.

Anyone who lives in the Western Hebrides will have often watched on a calm day the sea-birds feeding with noisy clamour in the sea-lochs and about the numerous islands. This is especially the case in August, when the shoals of small herring are very plentiful. Some years ago, when in a sailing-boat off the west coast of Mull, I caught with a hand-net a dishful of these small fry as they swam along the surface of the water. Last year, noticing from a steam-launch the birds congregated in great numbers at one spot, the idea struck me to steam to the place and try to get a share of the birds' repast. The idea was at once carried out. I stood on the prow with landing-net in hand, and the launch was steered towards the birds. As we drew near, the banqueters flew away with evident dissatisfaction at the interruption, a few of the more greedy making their last hasty dives. In another moment we were at the spot, and I saw, to my intense surprise, about 2 feet under the surface, a large reddish-brown ball, 2 to 3 feet in length and 2 feet in depth. I made a frantic swoop with the net into the ball, and brought on deck half a pailful of the sea-birds' dinner. Even as we passed we could see the great living ball sinking and breaking into pieces. This year I and others have tried the same spot with great success. Sometimes the ball has sunk too deep to be reached; some times there was no ball to be seen; but on the most successful day I filled a pailful in three hauls.

Anyone who lives in the Western Hebrides will have often watched on a calm day the sea-birds feeding with noisy clamour in the sea-lochs and about the numerous islands. This is especially the case in August, when the shoals of small herring are very plentiful. Some years ago, when in a sailing-boat off the west coast of Mull, I caught with a hand-net a dishful of these small fry as they swam along the surface of the water. Last year, noticing from a steam-launch the birds congregated in great numbers at one spot, the idea struck me to steam to the place and try to get a share of the birds' repast. The idea was at once carried out. I stood on the prow with landing-net in hand, and the launch was steered towards the birds. As we drew near, the banqueters flew away with evident dissatisfaction at the interruption, a few of the more greedy making their last hasty dives. In another moment we were at the spot, and I saw, to my intense surprise, about 2 feet under the surface, a large reddish-brown ball, 2 to 3 feet in length and 2 feet in depth. I made a frantic swoop with the net into the ball, and brought on deck half a pailful of the sea-birds' dinner. Even as we passed we could see the great living ball sinking and breaking into pieces. This year I and others have tried the same spot with great success. Sometimes the ball has sunk too deep to be reached; some times there was no ball to be seen; but on the most successful day I filled a pailful in three hauls. In September we saw no ball, because, perhaps, the fish had grown too large for the birds to manage. As far as I can judge, the modus operandi is carried out by the divers, who surround a shoal and hem them in on all sides, so that the terrified fish huddle together in a vain effort to escape inevitable destruction. The divers work from below and other sea-birds feed from above; and, as in some cases after the birds had been at work for some time I saw no ball, I suppose not one fish is left to tell the tale.

On the 13th, at 4h. 30m. a.m., a rather heavy concussion was felt at Caracas, and eastward as far as Rio Chico, where it caused some damage. On the 17th, two shocks were noticed at Cumana, viz. at 5h. 8m. a.m. and 2h. p.m. It is reported that their force diminished towards the east, so that they were scarcely perceptible at Car\u00fapano. On the same day two shocks (1h. 45m. and 5h. 15m. p.m.) damaged in a somewhat serious manner a large number of houses at Guanare (69\u00b0 20\u2032 W. of Greenwich, 8\u00b0 45\u2032 N. lat.); two more were felt at the same place on the 18th at 3h. p.m., and on the 19th at 1h. 10m. a.m. The ultimate sign of the paroxysm was observed at Caracas on the last-named day, a few minutes before five o'clock in the afternoon. The zone of disturbance extended from Car\u00fapano to Escuque (63\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 W. of Greenwich), and embraced the whole mountainous part of Northern Venezuela. In some cases the wave-motion is said to have been plainly north-east to southwest; but the maximum of disturbance (first shock at Guanare) showed decidedly a direction from north to south, as results from the numerous cracks in damaged walls and the way in which free-standing objects were thrown off their bases. The clock at the telegraph station, which hangs on a wall running east to west, was likewise instantly stopped. Dr. Lisandro Alvarado, a physician who resided at Guanare, who communicated these facts to me, informs me at the same time that the cracks emerge in an angle of from 75\u00b0 to 80\u00b0. It is therefore very likely that the centre of the shock was not far from Guanare towards the north, where the crystalline schists of the Cordillera break through the overlying clay-slates and Cretaceous rocks, which form the northern margin of the great plains or llanos of Venezuela. Guanare lies on the very edge of these plains (185 metres above the sea), where the Cretaceous formation rather abruptly is met by the extensive deposit of conglomerate which covers the plains. Any disturbance in the raised strata forming the southern slope of the Cordillera will thus manifest itself with particular intensity in the vicinity of this border-line. The whole disturbance belongs, of course, to the class of tectonic earthquakes, as, indeed, do all those which happen now and then in this country.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"39","prism.number":"1006","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"341","prism.endingPage":"341","prism.copyright":"1889 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/039341b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/039341b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/039341b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/039341b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Seismic Disturbance at Venezuela","citation_volume":"39","citation_issue":"1006","citation_publication_date":"1889/02","citation_firstpage":"341","citation_lastpage":"341","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/039341b0","DOI":"10.1038/039341b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/039341b0","description":"ABOUT the middle of November 1888, there was a notable seismic disturbance in several places of Northern Venezuela.

One of my principal arguments against the theory was that, if it were true, all cool stars should be variable, and I still see no reason to alter my views. The observations of the red stars by Dun\u00e9r show that the spectra of some of the stars which are not variable are identical with some of those which are.

One of my principal arguments against the theory was that, if it were true, all cool stars should be variable, and I still see no reason to alter my views. The observations of the red stars by Dun\u00e9r show that the spectra of some of the stars which are not variable are identical with some of those which are. For example, the spectra of 120 Schj., and D.M. + 47\u00b0 2291, which are not variable, are exactly like those of \u03c7 Cygni and R Leonis.

Resting immediately above, as far as could be made out among the recent talus, was the highly-contorted drift sand and loam usually observed hereabouts; no flint nodules, stones, or boulders could be seen in them, and it is difficult to understand how these, if they had been present, could groove the bed so persistently in one direction when shoots took place.","dc.creator":["SHERWOOD, WILLIAM"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["SHERWOOD, WILLIAM"],"citation_author_institution":["Sutton Coldfield,"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Striated Surface under the Cromer Drift","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Striated Surface under the Cromer Drift&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"045533b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The first time I noticed this effect was on the surface of a smoothly-boarded gate, where the parts behind which the bars of the framing ran were marked out by a much thicker coating of hoar-frost than the rest.

Ann. xxxii. p. 1, 1887. cf. p. 7 et Seq.), is that these gentlemen are abandoning a tried theory when its capabilities are far from exhausted. To begin at once with the most recent contribution to our knowledge of the subject, Mr. Bidwell's observation, let a series of excessively small condensation nuclei be enclosed in a vessel without further interference. They were active before being put there; but after remaining imprisoned for a sufficient length of time, Mr. Bidwell finds them shorn of their power to produce condensation in supersaturated steam.

Ann. xxxii. p. 1, 1887. cf. p. 7 et Seq.), is that these gentlemen are abandoning a tried theory when its capabilities are far from exhausted. To begin at once with the most recent contribution to our knowledge of the subject, Mr. Bidwell's observation, let a series of excessively small condensation nuclei be enclosed in a vessel without further interference. They were active before being put there; but after remaining imprisoned for a sufficient length of time, Mr. Bidwell finds them shorn of their power to produce condensation in supersaturated steam.

He found that in ordinary sea-water the typhoid bacillus suffered very considerably in the competition with the numerous other water bacteria present, but it was still identified on the ninth day after it was first introduced. In sea-water in which all other bacteria had been destroyed, the typhoid bacillus was detected in very appreciable numbers on the twenty-fifth day. More recently, however, the existence of typhoid bacilli in sterilised sea-water has been examined by Cassedebat, and his results are not in accord with those obtained by Giaxa. Cassedebat found that whilst many pathogenic bacteria, amongst which were those of anthrax and cholera, lived for several days, in the case of the former twenty-one to twenty-four days, and in that of the latter thirty-five days and even longer, typhoid bacilli were destroyed already in the course of forty-eight hours in sterilised sea-water. These results tend to confirm those obtained by Prof. Percy Frankland, who, in his last report to the Royal Society Water Research Committee, states that the addition of 1 and 3 per cent, of common salt to ordinary Thames water into which typhoid bacilli were introduced, acted very prejudicially on the latter, although it stimulated the multiplication of many forms of water bacteria present in a most astonishing manner. Similar results were obtained with salted but sterilised Thames water infected with typhoid bacilli, and not only did the latter disappear very rapidly, but the typhoid colonies which were obtained on plate-cultures from this salt water exhibited in some cases a very abnormal appearance, attributable to the degeneration of the typhoid bacilli under these conditions, for on passing such colonies through a further process of plate-culture, they returned to their ordinary type.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"51","prism.number":"1322","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"415","prism.endingPage":"416","prism.copyright":"1895 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/051415a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/051415a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/051415a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/051415a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Oysters and Typhoid","citation_volume":"51","citation_issue":"1322","citation_publication_date":"1895/02","citation_firstpage":"415","citation_lastpage":"416","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/051415a0","DOI":"10.1038/051415a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/051415a0","description":"WITH reference to the article \u201cOysters and Typhoid,\u201d which appeared in your last issue, it may interest your readers to know that De Giaxa investigated some years ago the behaviour of the typhoid bacillus in sea-water, both in its natural and sterilised condition.

The lack of light instruments which record automatically and continuously, prevented the success of the early experimenters. Such records are now obtained for the first time by means of kites at the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory, near Boston. A history of kite-flying for meteorological observations, with a general account of the work at the Blue Hill Observatory, was given by the Director, Mr. Rotch, in a paper read before the Physical Section of the British Association at the Liverpool meeting (1896). Notes in NATURE of October 22 and 29, vol. liv. pp. 598 and 629, mention briefly the altitudes to which a meteorograph has been lifted at Blue Hill during the past summer. A few of the details of the recent highest ascent may be of interest to the readers of NATURE, especially as it shows that clear and definite meteorological records can be obtained at a great height by means of kites, at a comparatively small expense. The meteorograph weighs three pounds, and records temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The record of October 8, from the earth's surface to an altitude of 9375 feet above sea level, was as clear and sharp as the records of similar instruments in thermometer screens at the observatory. The temperature scale on the chart is centigrade, and the humidity pen records 10 per cent, too low, so that 90 per cent, represents saturation. The barograph-pen is made to record altitudes in metre; but it went entirely off the scale, which is too small for the altitude reached. The record was, however, completed on the part of the chart above the scale. A determination of the altitude was made by placing the barograph under an air-pump, and finding the fall of pressure necessary to raise the barograph-pen to the highest point recorded when on the kite. From the amount of fall and the temperature recorded by the thermographs on the kite and at the observatory, the altitude was computed. The altitude was also computed from the angular elevation of the kites and the length of line recorded by a reel, 3 per cent, being allowed for the sag of the steel wire holding the kites. The amount of the sag was determined by previous the odolite measurement, from a long base line, of the altitude of the kites. The altitudes by the two methods agreed within 1 per cent, of the height, and the mean of the two is given. In this ascent nine kites with a total area of about 170 square feet and 18,000 feet of steel wire, weighing about 46 lbs., were used. All the work of the ascent was managed with an ordinary wooden windlass by the three members of the staff\u2014Mr. Fergusson, Mr. Sweetland and myself. The sea-coast is about six miles from Blue Hill, and the general level of the surrounding land is about 100 feet above sea-level. The top of Blue Hill, from which the kites were flown, is 635 feet above sea-level. Cumulus clouds had begun to form when the ascent began, and the meteorograph was soon elevated to the cloud-level, as shown by the humidity record, and was then lowered to remove a defective kite. In the second ascent the clouds were entered at an altitude of 4500 feet.

Such records are now obtained for the first time by means of kites at the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory, near Boston. A history of kite-flying for meteorological observations, with a general account of the work at the Blue Hill Observatory, was given by the Director, Mr. Rotch, in a paper read before the Physical Section of the British Association at the Liverpool meeting (1896). Notes in NATURE of October 22 and 29, vol. liv. pp. 598 and 629, mention briefly the altitudes to which a meteorograph has been lifted at Blue Hill during the past summer. A few of the details of the recent highest ascent may be of interest to the readers of NATURE, especially as it shows that clear and definite meteorological records can be obtained at a great height by means of kites, at a comparatively small expense. The meteorograph weighs three pounds, and records temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The record of October 8, from the earth's surface to an altitude of 9375 feet above sea level, was as clear and sharp as the records of similar instruments in thermometer screens at the observatory. The temperature scale on the chart is centigrade, and the humidity pen records 10 per cent, too low, so that 90 per cent, represents saturation. The barograph-pen is made to record altitudes in metre; but it went entirely off the scale, which is too small for the altitude reached. The record was, however, completed on the part of the chart above the scale. A determination of the altitude was made by placing the barograph under an air-pump, and finding the fall of pressure necessary to raise the barograph-pen to the highest point recorded when on the kite. From the amount of fall and the temperature recorded by the thermographs on the kite and at the observatory, the altitude was computed. The altitude was also computed from the angular elevation of the kites and the length of line recorded by a reel, 3 per cent, being allowed for the sag of the steel wire holding the kites. The amount of the sag was determined by previous the odolite measurement, from a long base line, of the altitude of the kites. The altitudes by the two methods agreed within 1 per cent, of the height, and the mean of the two is given. In this ascent nine kites with a total area of about 170 square feet and 18,000 feet of steel wire, weighing about 46 lbs., were used. All the work of the ascent was managed with an ordinary wooden windlass by the three members of the staff\u2014Mr. Fergusson, Mr. Sweetland and myself. The sea-coast is about six miles from Blue Hill, and the general level of the surrounding land is about 100 feet above sea-level. The top of Blue Hill, from which the kites were flown, is 635 feet above sea-level. Cumulus clouds had begun to form when the ascent began, and the meteorograph was soon elevated to the cloud-level, as shown by the humidity record, and was then lowered to remove a defective kite. In the second ascent the clouds were entered at an altitude of 4500 feet. The successive kites added to lift the line as they rose to the cloud-level, and again, when they were drawn below it, gave the data for numerous successive determinations of the altitude of the bases of the cumulus clouds, and furnish an example of the accuracy and frequency with which clouds can be measured in this manner, as shown by the following results:\u2014","dc.creator":["CLAYTON, H.

The theory which the reviewer laid to his charge was to the effect that the Greeks of the pre-Homeric and Homeric ages had a full knowledge of the constellations known to their descendants in Ptolemaic times; and, further, that they obtained such knowledge at this early period from the Babylonians through intercourse with the Ph\u0153nicians and the \u201cHittites.\u201d It is from this theory that the reviewer entirely dissents.

Upon their view a practical problem should be made the starting point, so that the development of the scientific method should follow instead of precede; e.g. from a study of the crane the class should discover the triangle of forces. The main argument for this procedure is that the boys actually want to know how a crane works, whereas interest in abstract principles does not, as a rule, outcrop until the age of sixteen or seventeen years. My own experience is distinctly in favour of the appeal to the utilitarian rather than to the scientific motive, except in the case of exceptional boys or of those above the age of seventeen.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"86","prism.number":"2171","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"484","prism.endingPage":"484","prism.copyright":"1911 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/086484b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/086484b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/086484b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/086484b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Teaching of Science in Secondary Schools","citation_volume":"86","citation_issue":"2171","citation_publication_date":"1911/06","citation_firstpage":"484","citation_lastpage":"484","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/086484b0","DOI":"10.1038/086484b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/086484b0","description":"THE report of the Board of Education on the above subject (see NATURE, May 4) contains many expressions of opinion with which I heartily agree.

Upon their view a practical problem should be made the starting point, so that the development of the scientific method should follow instead of precede; e.g. from a study of the crane the class should discover the triangle of forces. The main argument for this procedure is that the boys actually want to know how a crane works, whereas interest in abstract principles does not, as a rule, outcrop until the age of sixteen or seventeen years. My own experience is distinctly in favour of the appeal to the utilitarian rather than to the scientific motive, except in the case of exceptional boys or of those above the age of seventeen.","dc.creator":["DANIELL, G.

My position is simply this, that a theory has been put forward which seems to me, a priori, extremely improbable, and that the statistical data on which it is based are, to my mind, not strong enough to support it. The large assertion that the Norwegian spring herring have consisted, in preponderating or overwhelming proportion, year by year from 1908 to 1913, of fish spawned in 1904, 15 based (so far as I can discover) on only nineteen samples, or little more than two a year, averaging somewhat above 300 herring each. Dr. Hjort and Mr. Lea have no difficulty in showing that their 1913 herring, grouped according to scale-rings or alleged years of growth, form a curve which is a bad fit to a probability curve; but they do not remind us that this so-called sample is no sample at all, but is a conglomeration of three separate samples from far-distant localities.

Two very well-marked dark bands were seen rising from the south-eastern horizon across the pale pink counterglow.

The dark bands were the shadows of these clouds projected right across the sky. The shadows could be followed for some distance from the clouds, but were not visible in the plane at right angles to the direction of sunset. They were visible for quite ten minutes after I first noticed them, by which time the twilight arch was some way above the horizon and the dark bands rose from it. The two cumulo-nimbus clouds and a small patch of cirrus were the only clouds visible; their bearings were 302\u00b0 and 305\u00b0 respectively.

The morphological correlates of schizophrenia are subtle, and range from a slight reduction in brain size to localized alterations in the morphology and molecular composition of specific neuronal, synaptic, and glial populations in the hippocampus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and dorsal thalamus. These findings have fostered the view of schizophrenia as a disorder of connectivity and of the synapse. Although attractive, such concepts are vague, and differentiating primary events from epiphenomena has been difficult. A way forward is provided by the recent identification of several putative susceptibility genes (including neuregulin, dysbindin, COMT, DISC1, RGS4, GRM3, and G72). We discuss the evidence for these and other genes, along with what is known of their expression profiles and biological roles in brain and how these may be altered in schizophrenia.

Escherichia coli, for example, respond to changes in chemoattractant concentration of less than 10% over a range spanning six orders of magnitude1,2. Sensitivity over this range depends on a nonlinear relationship between ligand concentration and output response3. At low ligand concentrations, substantial amplification of the chemotactic signal is required; however, the mechanism responsible for this amplification remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that inter-receptor communication within a lattice4,5 acts to amplify and integrate sensory information. Synthetic multivalent ligands that interact through the low-abundance, galactose-sensing receptor Trg stabilize large clusters of chemoreceptors and markedly enhance signal output from these enforced clusters. On treatment with multivalent ligands, the response to the attractant serine is amplified by at least 100-fold.

Escherichia coli, for example, respond to changes in chemoattractant concentration of less than 10% over a range spanning six orders of magnitude1,2. Sensitivity over this range depends on a nonlinear relationship between ligand concentration and output response3. At low ligand concentrations, substantial amplification of the chemotactic signal is required; however, the mechanism responsible for this amplification remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that inter-receptor communication within a lattice4,5 acts to amplify and integrate sensory information. Synthetic multivalent ligands that interact through the low-abundance, galactose-sensing receptor Trg stabilize large clusters of chemoreceptors and markedly enhance signal output from these enforced clusters. On treatment with multivalent ligands, the response to the attractant serine is amplified by at least 100-fold. This amplification requires a full complement of chemoreceptors; deletion of the aspartate (Tar) or dipeptide (Tap) receptors diminishes the amplification of the serine response. These results demonstrate that the entire array is involved in sensing. This mode of information exchange has general implications for the processing of signals by cellular receptors.","dc.creator":["Gestwicki, Jason E.","Kiessling, Laura L."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=J.

Membrane-based separation technologies1,2, in which the target molecule is selectively extracted and transported across a membrane, are potentially more economical and easier to implement than competing separations methods; but membranes with higher transport selectivities are required. Here we describe an approach for preparing highly selective membranes which involves immobilizing apoenzymes within a microporous composite. The apoenzyme selectively recognizes its substrate molecule and transports it across the composite membrane, without effecting the unwanted chemical conversion of the substrate molecule to product.

Membrane-based separation technologies1,2, in which the target molecule is selectively extracted and transported across a membrane, are potentially more economical and easier to implement than competing separations methods; but membranes with higher transport selectivities are required. Here we describe an approach for preparing highly selective membranes which involves immobilizing apoenzymes within a microporous composite. The apoenzyme selectively recognizes its substrate molecule and transports it across the composite membrane, without effecting the unwanted chemical conversion of the substrate molecule to product. We demonstrate this approach using three different apoenzymes. Most importantly, it can be used to make enantioselective membranes for chiral separations, one of the most challenging and important problems in bioseparations technology. We are able to achieve a fivefold difference between the transport rates of D- and L-amino acids.","dc.creator":["Lakshmi, Brinda B.","Martin, Charles R."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_title=Membrane Separation Systems; citation_publication_date=1991; citation_id=CR1; citation_author=RW Baker","citation_title=Membrane Handbook; citation_publication_date=1992; citation_id=CR2; citation_author=WH Winston; citation_author=KK Sirkar","citation_title=The Movement of Molecules Across Cell Membranes; citation_publication_date=1967; citation_id=CR3; citation_author=WD Stein","citation_journal_title=Science; citation_title=Oxygen transport through haemoglobin solutions.; citation_author=PF Scholander; citation_volume=131; citation_publication_date=1960; citation_pages=585-590; citation_doi=10.1126/science.131.3400.585; citation_id=CR4","citation_journal_title=Bull.

At still greater distances is believed to lie the Oort cloud\u2014a massive population of cometary objects distributed approximately in a sphere of characteristic dimension 50,000au(ref. 6). Here we report the discovery of an object, 1996TL66, that appears to be representative of a population of scattered bodies located between the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud. 1996TL66has an orbital semimajor axis of 84au, and is in an extremely eccentric and highly inclined orbit (e = 0.58, i = 24\u00b0). With a red magnitude \u223c20.9, it is the brightest trans-neptunian object yet found since Pluto and Charon. Its discovery suggests that the Kuiper belt extends substantially beyond the 30\u201350auregion sampled by previous surveys, and may contain much more mass than previously suspected.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"387","prism.number":"6633","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"573","prism.endingPage":"575","prism.copyright":"1997 Macmillan Magazines Ltd.","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/42413","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/42413","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/42413.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/42413","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"A new dynamical class of object in the outer Solar System","citation_volume":"387","citation_issue":"6633","citation_publication_date":"1997/06","citation_firstpage":"573","citation_lastpage":"575","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/42413","DOI":"10.1038/42413","citation_doi":"10.1038/42413","description":"Some three dozen objects have now been discovered1,2,3,4,5 beyond the orbit of Neptune and classified as members of the Kuiper belt\u2014a remnant population of icy planetesimals that failed to be incorporated into planets.

A common region of the T antigen is critical for binding both p300/CBP and the tumour suppressor p53 (ref. 1), suggesting a link between the functions of p53 and p300. Here we report that p300/CBP binds to p53 in the absence of viral oncoproteins, and that p300 and p53 colocalize within the nucleus and coexist in a stable DNA-binding complex. Consistent with its ability to bind to p300, E1A disrupted functions mediated by p53. It reduced p53-mediated activation of the p21 and bax promoters, and suppressed p53-induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis.

Disruption of p300/p53-dependent growth control may be part of the mechanism by which E1A induces cell transformation.

The main benefit from group display is thought to be an increase in the number of females arriving per male. However, when mating success is highly skewed it is not clear why unsuccessful males participate in group display1. In theory, all males on leks could obtain indirect fitness benefits if displaying groups consisted of related individuals2. Here we present two independent sets of data that show that peacocks (Pavo cristatus) display close to their kin. DNA fingerprinting showed that males at Whipsnade Park were more closely related to males within the same lek than to males at other leks. Separately, we found that after an experimental release of a mixed group of related and unrelated males, brothers (paternal sibs or half-sibs) established permanent display sites very close together. This result is unexpected, as the released birds could not become familiar with their brothers during their development.

The main benefit from group display is thought to be an increase in the number of females arriving per male. However, when mating success is highly skewed it is not clear why unsuccessful males participate in group display1. In theory, all males on leks could obtain indirect fitness benefits if displaying groups consisted of related individuals2. Here we present two independent sets of data that show that peacocks (Pavo cristatus) display close to their kin. DNA fingerprinting showed that males at Whipsnade Park were more closely related to males within the same lek than to males at other leks. Separately, we found that after an experimental release of a mixed group of related and unrelated males, brothers (paternal sibs or half-sibs) established permanent display sites very close together. This result is unexpected, as the released birds could not become familiar with their brothers during their development. The released young were hatched from eggs that had been removed from their parents shortly after laying and mixed with the eggs of non-relatives. These data indicate that birds can evolve a means of kin association that does not involve learning the characteristics of relatives or the use of environmental cues. If social learning is not necessary for kin association then kin effects may be of more widespread importance in avian social interactions, and in particular in the evolution of lek mating, than previously appreciated.","dc.creator":["Petrie, Marion","Krupa, Andrew","Burke, Terry"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["H\u00f6glund,J. & Alatalo,R.

The crossed electric and magnetic fields cause electrons to drift parallel to the sample boundary, creating a chiral current that travels along the edge in only one direction. In an ideal two-dimensional electron system in the quantum Hall regime, all the current flows along the edge4,5,6. Quantization of the Hall resistance arises from occupation of N one-dimensional edge channels, each contributing a conductance of e2/h (refs 7,8,9,10,11). Here we report differential conductance measurements, in the integer quantum Hall regime, of tunnelling between the edges of a pair of two-dimensional electron systems that are separated by an atomically precise, high-quality, tunnel barrier. The resultant interaction between the edge states leads to the formation of new energy gaps and an intriguing dispersion relation for electrons travelling along the barrier: for example, we see a persistent conductance peak at zero bias voltage and an absence of tunnelling features due to electron spin. These features are unexpected and are not consistent with a model of weakly interacting edge states. Remnant disorder along the barrier and charge screening may each play a role, although detailed numerical studies will be required to elucidate these effects.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"403","prism.number":"6765","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"59","prism.endingPage":"61","prism.copyright":"2000 Macmillan Magazines Ltd.","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/47436","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/47436","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/47436.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/47436","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Tunnelling between the edges of two lateral quantum Hall systems","citation_volume":"403","citation_issue":"6765","citation_publication_date":"2000/01","citation_firstpage":"59","citation_lastpage":"61","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/47436","DOI":"10.1038/47436","citation_doi":"10.1038/47436","description":"The edge of a two-dimensional electron system in a magnetic field consists of one-dimensional channels that arise from the confining electric field at the edge of the system1,2,3. The crossed electric and magnetic fields cause electrons to drift parallel to the sample boundary, creating a chiral current that travels along the edge in only one direction. In an ideal two-dimensional electron system in the quantum Hall regime, all the current flows along the edge4,5,6. Quantization of the Hall resistance arises from occupation of N one-dimensional edge channels, each contributing a conductance of e2/h (refs 7,8,9,10,11). Here we report differential conductance measurements, in the integer quantum Hall regime, of tunnelling between the edges of a pair of two-dimensional electron systems that are separated by an atomically precise, high-quality, tunnel barrier.

Characterization of a subset of xenograft models by immunohistochemical biomarkers and by RNA transcript microarray analysis showed good fidelity in the recapitulation of gene expression patterns in the xenograft tumors compared with the human donor tumors. As ACC is known to frequently contain a t(6;9) translocation that fuses the MYB and NFIB genes, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of 12 ACC xenograft models was performed that assayed MYB locus break-apart and MYB\u2013NFIB locus fusion. Of 12 xenograft models, 11 (92%) revealed MYB locus rearrangement and 10 (83%) showed evidence of fusion of the MYB and NFIB loci.

We recently developed a nanomanipulation technique for the extraction and identification of DNA contained within sub-nuclear locations of a single cell nucleus. In nanomanipulation of sub-cellular structures, a key step is to identify targets of interest through correlating fluorescence and SEM images. The DNA extraction task must be conducted with low accelerating voltages resulting in low imaging resolutions. This is imposed by the necessity of preserving the biochemical integrity of the sample. Such poor imaging conditions make the identification of nanometer-sized fiducial marks difficult. This paper presents an affine scale-invariant feature transform (ASIFT) based method for correlating SEM images and fluorescence microscopy images. The performance of the image correlation approach under different noise levels and imaging magnifications was quantitatively evaluated. The optimal mean absolute error (MAE) of correlation results is 68\u00b134\u2005nm under standard conditions. Compared with manual correlation by skilled operators, the automated correlation approach demonstrates a speed that is higher by an order of magnitude. With the SEM-fluorescence image correlation approach, targeted DNA was successfully extracted via nanomanipulation under SEM conditions. A fast method for correlating scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescence images when handling subcellular objects has been acheived. Yu Sun of the University of Toronto, Canada, and co-workers in China and Canada developed the image correlation technique to improve the implementation of a method for extracting DNA from cells. Such correlation is essential, because SEM images lack sufficient contrast to enable structures of interest to be identified and because of the need to use low-energy (and hence low-resolution) SEM imaging to avoid damaging DNA. Their correlation technique employs image processing algorithms to automatically correlate the two microscopy techniques and is an order of magnitude faster than manual image correlation by skilled operators. The researchers have demonstrated the method's usefulness by using it to extract DNA from cells under SEM imaging.","prism.publicationName":"Light: Science & Applications","prism.publicationDate":"2014-11-21","prism.volume":"3","prism.number":"11","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"e224","prism.endingPage":"e224","prism.copyright":"2014 The Author(s)","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa2014105","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2014.105","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa2014105.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa2014105","citation_journal_title":"Light: Science & Applications","citation_journal_abbrev":"Light Sci Appl","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"2047-7538","citation_title":"Fluorescence and SEM correlative microscopy for nanomanipulation of subcellular structures","citation_volume":"3","citation_issue":"11","citation_publication_date":"2014/11","citation_online_date":"2014/11/21","citation_firstpage":"e224","citation_lastpage":"e224","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2014.105","DOI":"10.1038/lsa.2014.105","citation_doi":"10.1038/lsa.2014.105","description":"Nanomanipulation under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) enables direct interactions of a tool with a sample.

The performance of the image correlation approach under different noise levels and imaging magnifications was quantitatively evaluated. The optimal mean absolute error (MAE) of correlation results is 68\u00b134\u2005nm under standard conditions. Compared with manual correlation by skilled operators, the automated correlation approach demonstrates a speed that is higher by an order of magnitude. With the SEM-fluorescence image correlation approach, targeted DNA was successfully extracted via nanomanipulation under SEM conditions. A fast method for correlating scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescence images when handling subcellular objects has been acheived. Yu Sun of the University of Toronto, Canada, and co-workers in China and Canada developed the image correlation technique to improve the implementation of a method for extracting DNA from cells. Such correlation is essential, because SEM images lack sufficient contrast to enable structures of interest to be identified and because of the need to use low-energy (and hence low-resolution) SEM imaging to avoid damaging DNA. Their correlation technique employs image processing algorithms to automatically correlate the two microscopy techniques and is an order of magnitude faster than manual image correlation by skilled operators. The researchers have demonstrated the method's usefulness by using it to extract DNA from cells under SEM imaging.","dc.creator":["Gong, Zheng","Chen, Brandon K","Liu, Jun","Zhou, Chao","Anchel, Dave","Li, Xiao","Ge, Ji","Bazett-Jones, David P","Sun, Yu"],"dc.subject":["Nanobiotechnology","Scanning electron microscopy"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Curr Opin Genet Dev;
