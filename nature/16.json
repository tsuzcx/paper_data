During the early part of the morning the suspended magnets were so much disturbed that I considered it useless to continue a series of absolute determinations of the magnetic elements on which I was engaged. The auroral display when first noticed bore a very striking resemblance to the effect produced by a brisk and squally wind passing over an otherwise calm lake. Magnetic clouds overspread the northern half of the sky, and were abruptly terminated by an irregular arch, stretching from the magnetic E. to W., and passing almost through the zenith. This arch was never very well defined, but it served for some time as an apparent barrier to the rapid passage of the waves of magnetic light from the N. towards 9h 45m P.M. The whole N. horizon was brilliantly illuminated, but in some points more so than in others, and from these points broad streamers darted forth, extending often from the horizon to the zenith.

During the early part of the morning the suspended magnets were so much disturbed that I considered it useless to continue a series of absolute determinations of the magnetic elements on which I was engaged. The auroral display when first noticed bore a very striking resemblance to the effect produced by a brisk and squally wind passing over an otherwise calm lake. Magnetic clouds overspread the northern half of the sky, and were abruptly terminated by an irregular arch, stretching from the magnetic E. to W., and passing almost through the zenith. This arch was never very well defined, but it served for some time as an apparent barrier to the rapid passage of the waves of magnetic light from the N. towards 9h 45m P.M. The whole N. horizon was brilliantly illuminated, but in some points more so than in others, and from these points broad streamers darted forth, extending often from the horizon to the zenith. Several of these stupendous beams of light, many degrees in breadth, were sometimes seen at once, and occasionally the whole N. horizon shot forth these brilliant streamers. The colour of the beams was often red, but more frequently white, but many changed from white to red, or red to white, before vanishing from sight. The sky at times was partly of a deep red hue.","dc.creator":["PERRY, S.

A mass of light, composed of red and bluish-white streamers or rays, moved rapidly up from about W.S.W. to E.N.E., and the whole took the form of an arch overhanging for a short space of time the western horizon, while transverse waves of light, intensifying the lustre of the blue portions, and occasionally reaching almost to the zenith, rolled across the nebulous mass at intervals of about a second. Streamers projecting eastwards kept shooting out with great brilliancy, like sheet lightning, except that they were separated by a sharp line from the dark surrounding sky. Each flash made a fresh advance eastwards, like the skirmishers preceding an army, and a few bright crimson clouds alone kept nearly the same position throughout the display,\u2014the finest of these was nearly in the S.W. At one time, when the flashes and waves had ceased, an umbrella-like radiation of red and white rays from the zenith attained great beauty. By five minutes past ten the sky had regained a more ordinary hue, but dull red clouds still remained, and in the west a white phosphorescence like early dawn. The night was calm and rather cold; the barometer 30.00 and steady. The wind had been gusty from E. in the afternoon. I had remarked during the daytime some very rare and beautiful modifications of cirrus and wave-cloud stretching from W.S.W. to E.N.E. (a direction coinciding with that of the aurora streamers), and crossed by bars at right angles to them at a lower elevation. The arrangement of these clouds showed that they were strongly acted on by electricity, as is generally, perhaps, the case with wave-cloud. May not vapours of this kind in a peculiar state produce the apparent polarisation of the sun's rays recorded by \u201cJ. W.\u201d in the Times of April 8? To-day, especially, between twelve and one o'clock, detached cumuli, driving rapidly from about E.S.E. and upper cirro-cumuli from E.N.E., have behaved in a manner quite unlike anything I have observed before. The only cirro-cumulus to be seen in the morning shot out branches in advancing and melted away between the branches, leaving a sort of skeleton of spine and ribs, which in their turn were dissipated. The cumulus motions were also unusual, for portions were suddenly arrested, remaining fixed, and then rose apparently and arranged themselves in bands more or less parallel until dissolved. The last phenomena only occurred, as far as I could see, below some whitish rays, extending across the sky from W.S.W. to E.N.E., parallel to the aurora streamers of last evening, and closely resembling the beams of light which often proceed from the sun when behind a cloud on a showery day. Either an aurora must be going on to-day, or the higher atmosphere is in a peculiar electrical state. The influence of these whitish bands on the clouds at a much lower level is at any rate remarkably powerful.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"3","prism.number":"76","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"468","prism.endingPage":"468","prism.copyright":"1871 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003468c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/003468c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003468c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003468c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Aurora","citation_volume":"3","citation_issue":"76","citation_publication_date":"1871/04","citation_firstpage":"468","citation_lastpage":"468","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/003468c0","DOI":"10.1038/003468c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/003468c0","description":"LAST evening, at about 9.50, my attention was called to a magnificent display of aurora borealis.

Towards 7 o'clock a hazy light began to spread itself over the northern sky, near the horizon, not unlike a brilliant twilight. At 8 P.M. two arches were quite distinct, the upper one being well defined, with its apex passing through the head of Ursa Major. Gradually streamers began to pass from this, and by 9h. 15m. the scene was simply gorgeous. I do not remember ever seeing the streamers so expanded\u2014more like flames, nor possessing such intense whiteness, so much so, that the evening was almost as light as if the moon had been shining. After proceeding from the upper arch, their course was most rapid to the zenith\u2014apparently passing at times behind clouds, then suddenly emerging\u2014where a magnificent whirling motion was formed, which kept changing in true Protean fashion. A grand, though somewhat dingy, red haze next appeared in the west, which gradually ascended towards the zenith, when it disappeared. Meanwhile flashes of light, resembling summer lightning, darted upwards from about 45\u00b0 from all directions, and not least from the south\u2014the N.W. heavens assuming a muddy green colour. About a quarter-past ten P.M. the aurora gradually diminished, especially the upper arch, and streamers from it.

Towards 7 o'clock a hazy light began to spread itself over the northern sky, near the horizon, not unlike a brilliant twilight. At 8 P.M. two arches were quite distinct, the upper one being well defined, with its apex passing through the head of Ursa Major. Gradually streamers began to pass from this, and by 9h. 15m. the scene was simply gorgeous. I do not remember ever seeing the streamers so expanded\u2014more like flames, nor possessing such intense whiteness, so much so, that the evening was almost as light as if the moon had been shining. After proceeding from the upper arch, their course was most rapid to the zenith\u2014apparently passing at times behind clouds, then suddenly emerging\u2014where a magnificent whirling motion was formed, which kept changing in true Protean fashion. A grand, though somewhat dingy, red haze next appeared in the west, which gradually ascended towards the zenith, when it disappeared. Meanwhile flashes of light, resembling summer lightning, darted upwards from about 45\u00b0 from all directions, and not least from the south\u2014the N.W. heavens assuming a muddy green colour. About a quarter-past ten P.M. the aurora gradually diminished, especially the upper arch, and streamers from it. Then the lower arch began to give off streamers, but these were short and of short duration, though of considerable brightness. The display of Friday, if it fell short of those of October 23 and 24, 1870, in point of brilliant colours, surpassed them in some respects \u2014 e.g. extent of streamers, and brilliancy of light.

The passage, given almost word for word by Lord Bolingbroke in the quotation made by Prof. Jevons, occurs somewhat incidentally in two parts of Maupertuis' writings; in the memoir alluded to (\u201cLes Loix du Mouvement et du Repos, d\u00e9duites d'un principe m\u00e9taphysique\u201d); and in the \u201cEssay de Cosmologie,\u201d into which the memoir was expanded five years later (1751). In both these works Maupertuis is chiefly concerned with establishing his well-known metaphysico-mechanical principle of \u201cThe Least Action\u201d (\u201cLa moindre Quantit\u00e9 d'Action\u201d); and with deducing therefrom proof of the existence of God.

The passage, given almost word for word by Lord Bolingbroke in the quotation made by Prof. Jevons, occurs somewhat incidentally in two parts of Maupertuis' writings; in the memoir alluded to (\u201cLes Loix du Mouvement et du Repos, d\u00e9duites d'un principe m\u00e9taphysique\u201d); and in the \u201cEssay de Cosmologie,\u201d into which the memoir was expanded five years later (1751). In both these works Maupertuis is chiefly concerned with establishing his well-known metaphysico-mechanical principle of \u201cThe Least Action\u201d (\u201cLa moindre Quantit\u00e9 d'Action\u201d); and with deducing therefrom proof of the existence of God. But the doctrine of \u201cThe Survival of the Fittest\u201d is more clearly discernible, and more than incidentally referred to, in his small physiological treatise, \u201cVenus physique\u201d (\u0152uvres, tome ii. ed. 1756).

MARTIUS found the rude natives of Brazil treating the hunting-ground of each tribe as common to all the tribesmen, but allowing each family to hold as its own freehold the ground which it had built huts on, or brought under tillage. It is not surprising that this ethnologist, comparing such a rudimentary form of the \u201cvillage community\u201d with its more artificial arrangements in ancient Europe, should have considered the Brazilian tribes to have arrived at an intermediate stage of the development of land-laws, above that of the lowest savages, and on the way to that of more civilised nations. Mr. Edkins, however, in his letter to NATURE, vol. x. p. 163, thinks that Dr. Martius should not have explained the origin of the Brazilian land-law in this obvious way. The suggestion which he offers in its place is, that inasmuch as the Chinese had in old times a highly artificial system of partitioning their village-lands among the heads of families, some of these Chinese are to be supposed to have emigrated to the Brazilian forests and introduced this system, which in course of ages decayed till nothing was left but the simple rule found by Dr. Martius. But is not the word \u201cfar-fetched\u201d applicable to this argument? Sooner than allow the rude people of Brazil to have been human beings capable of adopting the simplest social regulation for their own evident benefit, Mr. Edkins sends half-way round the world for imaginary Chinese emigrants, to introduce, not the savage law itself, but a civilised law which, if broken down to its last remnant, might be reduced to the Brazilian level. And, one may go on to ask, where is it likely that the Chinese themselves got their law of village-lands, if it was not developed out of lower stages of the law of property, belonging to lower stages of civilisation? If Mr. Edkins would turn his great knowledge of Chinese matters to investigating the origin of Chinese institutions, I think he would contribute new evidence to the development-theory of culture. Mr. Edkins next brings forward the evidence of numerals in Polynesia as proof of degeneracy in civilisation. The fact that the word mano means 10,000 in the Tonga Islands, 4,000 in the Sandwich Islands, and 1,000 in New Zealand, he accounts for on the supposition that the highest number was the original meaning, but that it was lowered with a fall in civilisation. But he will, I think, on further examination be satisfied that the real reason has nothing to do with degeneration, but with the curious Polynesian habit of counting by twos, fours, and even tens. Thus rau and mano, which in New Zealand mean 100 and 1,000, come to mean in Hawaii so many fours, viz. 400 and 4,000; Mr. Edkins' own example from Ponape shows the same done with tens (see Hale's \u201cEthnography of Wilkes' Expedition\u201d). Mr. Edkins also remarks that \u201cthe Polynesians formerly had a decimal arithmetic; now it has sunk in Australia to quaternary or quinary arithmetic.\u201d But the Australians are not of the same race as the Polynesians, nor is there the least reason to suppose that they were ever at a Polynesian level of culture. As the evidence of numerals has been introduced, it may be mentioned that both Australians and Polynesians use numerals derived from counting on the fingers. Thus the Polynesian lima, i.e. \u201chand,\u201d is the ordinary numeral for five, while the West Australian will say \u201cthe hand on either side and half the feet,\u201d meaning by this long expression the number 15 (see my \u201cPrimitive Culture,\u201d chap. 7). I may add that I have been trying for years to get any degenerationist to answer the argument from numerals of this very common class, which can only have arisen by development from the lower stage of counting on the fingers, and which therefore prove savage tribes to be capable of independent intellectual development.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"10","prism.number":"246","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"205","prism.endingPage":"205","prism.copyright":"1874 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/010205a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/010205a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/010205a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/010205a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Degeneracy of Man","citation_volume":"10","citation_issue":"246","citation_publication_date":"1874/07","citation_firstpage":"205","citation_lastpage":"205","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/010205a0","DOI":"10.1038/010205a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/010205a0","description":"DR.

It is specially interesting to the Birmingham Natural History and Microscopical Society, and as president of the Society and reporter during the marine excursion to Teignmouth in 1873, alluded to by Major Lang, I must say that I read it with very great surprise and pleasure. My knowledge of the locality has extended over a period of about thirteen years, and during that time I have on several occasions dredged the ground which he mentions, and never once succeeded in taking an adult specimen of the rosy feather star, much less the more interesting pedunculate form of it. I have not, however, dredged there since our marine excursion. Mr. Gosse, whose experience is very large, and who resides in the neighbourhood, to whom I showed our mounted specimens, had never before seen the animal in that form, and there is no mention made of the adult animal in any of his descriptive works except in \u201cA Year at the Shore,\u201d where at p. 182 he states, \u201cWe sometimes but very rarely find on this coast a very lovely form of this class of animals.\u2026.

This land is exceedingly poor; almost without exception it is worthless to the coffee-planter for purposes of cultivation, and. incapable of supporting any vegetation except its own acrid m\u00e0n\u00e0 grass (Andropogon sch\u00e6nanthus) and a few stunted specimens of Careyaarborea and Emblica officinalis. Yet on all sides of it will probably be found a rich forest vegetation that grows luxuriantly up to the very edge of the grass, where it terminates abruptly without any dwarfed or stunted undergrowth on the border-line to show that the soil gradually changes from a fertile to a sterile character. Sir Emerson Tennant, in seeking for an explanation of this curious phenomenon, appears to have been completely baffled, for he suggests nothing beyond what is contained in a quotation from Humboldt in reference to the grassy plains of South America, where that great traveller speaks of the destructive custom of setting fire to the woods when the natives want to convert the soil into pasture. One reason, which seems to be quite conclusive against this explanation being applied to the grass-lands of Ceylon, is that cleared forest-land, however neglected and impoverished, does not run into grass such as is found on these Patenas, but into a dwarfish jungle called \u201cchena,\u201d and then again, after a considerable period of time, into forest. Besides, it very frequently happens that these grasslands are the very last pieces of ground that one would expect the natives to select out of the forest to bestow labour on in clearing and burning. Another and minor argument against this view is that the natives, whose traditions extend back for a considerable period of time, can give no account of the origin of Patena-lands, as no doubt they would be able to do if their ancestors and themselves were the cause of their existence. Other causes, therefore, than that of human agency must be sought for. One of these I believe I discovered during my residence in Ceylon, and I should be glad to learn whether any of the readers of NATURE have noticed the same in any part of the gneiss formation of Southern India, or indeed in any extensive gneiss formation within or without the Tropics. How far this particular cause operates in other instances than the one presently to be mentioned I am unable to say, but I am inclined to the belief that although it does not hold universally, it nevertheless holds pretty generally in the case of the larger patenas. It must be remembered that the mountain region of Ceylon is entirely a gneiss formation, very much dislocated during upheaval, and consisting at the present time of exceedingly deep valleys and precipitous mountain ranges. In this gneissic series occurs a band of half-formed quartzite several hundreds of feet ia thickness, to which my attention was first attracted by noticing that below it, i.e., where its d\u00e9bris accumulated, nothing but patena was to be found, whilst above, where the ordinary gneiss rocks were in a state of disintegration, the jungle and coffee was of a most luxuriant character. This band of quartzite stands out from the ordinary gneiss cliffs in the valley leading from Pussellawa to Ramboda, about twenty miles south of ECandy. It extends for about five miles in the form of a cliff, broken through here and there by ravines. Its upper surface, beginning at an elevation of 4,500 feet on the Helbodde coffee estate, dips under the main waterfall at Ramboda, and disappears under the ordinary gneiss at an elevation of about 3,000 feet above sea-level. This rock weathers very black, and is distinguishable at a distance of several miles from the ordinary gneiss above it and in its neighbourhood. It seems to disintegrate into little else than a quartz sand impregnated with iron and entirely incapable of supporting the usual forest vegetation with which the district, except in this particular spot, abounds. I have been informed that in the extensive patena district of Ouvah, which, roughly speaking, is a plain almost surrounded by mountains, a few miles south of the district just mentioned, and separated from it by the loftiest mass of mountains in the island, the same quartzite formation occurs, but not having had an opportunity of visiting and examining it, I am unable to say how far this information is to be relied on. When one remembers how very extensively the gneiss is broken up throughout the whole of this mountain region of the Kandyan province, it seems not improbable that other patenas, especially the larger ones, owe their origin to the cropping out of this quartzite band, although it is difficult, probably impossible in many cases, to determine that such is the case.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"15","prism.number":"384","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"398","prism.endingPage":"398","prism.copyright":"1877 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/015398c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/015398c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/015398c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/015398c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Patenas or Grass Lands of the Mountain Region of Ceylon","citation_volume":"15","citation_issue":"384","citation_publication_date":"1877/03","citation_firstpage":"398","citation_lastpage":"398","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/015398c0","DOI":"10.1038/015398c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/015398c0","description":"EVERYONE who has travelled through the Central Province of Ceylon must have been struck by the occurrence, apparently without sufficient cause, of tracts of grass-land varying from a few perches to hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of acres in extent, in the midst of otherwise interminable jungle.

My experience is mainly confined to the natives about the Condamine and its affluents, where I was frequently in company with natives for about a year. They had two weapons\u2014one large, for war, the other small, for game. I should think the weapon is seldom thrown in war, since most of their contests (such as they are) take place in scrubb or forest, where it could not be used to advantage; but I have seen a native frightfully cut in the abdomen, and was told by a native that he had been struck by a boomerang thrown by the hostile party. I have seen a few of these contests, but never saw the boomerang used in any way. The \u201cwaddys\u201d were thrown freely, the spear seldom. The game boomerang is thrown among nights of ducks, and also parrots when congregated on the trees and gathering nectar from their flowers, and with marked effect. This I have seen several times. There are two ways of throwing the weapon, which, as I could throw it well at one time, I will endeavour to describe. It is grasped quite at the end by the right hand and raised above the head, the elbow being bent, the weapon assuming a position with its convex edge downwards on a nearly horizontal line at right angles to the intended line of flight. The arm is brought swiftly round from left to right, becoming gradually extended until it reaches a line directly in front of the face, when the weapon is delivered from the now straight arm, with the concave edge towards the line of flight. This is the method of throwing into the air. No dependence can be placed on the return of the weapon within a circle of twenty yards, though it sometimes returns dangerously near the thrower. If it meets with an obstacle it is either stopped and falls dead to the earth, or its course is changed. In either case its peculiar motion is destroyed, as must be obvious. In the other method of throwing the weapon is held in the same way, but delivered nearly on line with the hip, and made to strike the earth about ten yards in front of the thrower, pitching, I believe (though it is not easy to observe), on one of its horns. Thence it ricochets and flies straight away for perhaps seventy or eighty yards, keeping a position of about four feet from the earth, and gradually rising until it is spent. It returns very little if at all. In this way only can it be used for war, since in the other it begins to mount at once, and would soon be above the enemy's head. The weapon is made of various woods, a piece with a slight elbow being selected. It is hardened by baking. The right form is arrived at by trial, as I have seen during the process of manufacture.

In Lysimachia nemorum the leaves are opposite, inflorescence indefinite, solitary, and axillary, but it will be observed that the flowers springing from the axils of opposite leaves are never both equally developed at the same time, one will be fully expanded while the other is yet in bud, or one will be found in seed and the other in. flower; it will be further observed that the oldest or most fully developed flower appears alternately on opposite sides of the stem; if all the leaves on this plant were separated by internodes, the arrangement would be tetrastichous, but owing to the suppression of the internodes between the first and second and the third and fourth leaves, the arrangement becomes opposite. The oldest of the two opposite flowers of each pair of leaves will be found to spring from the axil of the first, third, and fifth leaf, and plants with this alternate disposition of flowers may sometimes be met with; but usually a flower originates in the axil of each leaf, and then the youngest or latest flowers spring from the second and fourth leaves of the verticil; these latter may be looked upon as originating from arrested branches. This view is supported by the fact that plants may be sometimes found which, in place of producing the late flowers in the axils of the third and fourth leaves, produce branches from these points instead. In Caryophyllace\u00e6 the opposite sides of the cymose inflorescence never exhibit an equal amount of development at the same time, proving that one of the sides is older than the other, although, owing to non-development of an internode, it is at the same level. A similar arrangement occurs in Labiate plants, but owing to the crowded inflorescence, it is not so evident, but it is very marked where branches spring from opposite leaves; one is generally two or three times as long as the other, and by tracing the arrangement of these long branches along the stem, the normal alternate arrangement may be determined. In Scrophulariace\u00e6, where both opposite and alternate leaves are met with, all the above-mentioned modifications may be seen.

The suppression of the alternate nodes of an alternate-leaved plant with axillary inflorescence would produce the arrangement seen in Lysimachia, inasmuch as it would bring together flowers of different ages and in different stages of expansion; but in this instance all the flowers would belong to the same generation or be the product of the same stem, whereas in Lysimachia the earliest developed of each pair of opposite flowers alone belong to the stem, while the later flower of each pair belong to another generation, and spring from a branch originating in the axil of the leaf opposite (owing to non-development of an internode) to the early flower; the branch, however, is generally arrested, and the flower alone appears, although sometimes the branch is more or less developed.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"16","prism.number":"402","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"208","prism.endingPage":"208","prism.copyright":"1877 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/016208b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/016208b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/016208b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/016208b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Phyllotaxis","citation_volume":"16","citation_issue":"402","citation_publication_date":"1877/07","citation_firstpage":"208","citation_lastpage":"208","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/016208b0","DOI":"10.1038/016208b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/016208b0","description":"THE theory which regards the alternate arrangement of leaves as the normal mode receives some support from the arrangement of the inflorescence of opposite leaved plants.

I have often looked out for it since, but only once with success, and then it only showed itself in a single flash out of many. On both occasions the \u201cpunctuated\u201d flashes presented in general a curved or sinuous line without sharp angles; and two or three of them in the first-mentioned storm appeared to my eye as closed curves, one an almost perfect figure of 8; but their dazzling brightness made it impossible to speak to this with certainty.","dc.creator":["LAWRENCE, E.

As the rat had never found food there before, the writer concludes that his conduct cannot be attributed either to instinct or to experience, but must be ascribed to a process of reasoning based on the observation of the flocking together of the birds, and the inference that they must be attracted by food. Now it seems to me that before we ascribe to a rat such complicated reasoning powers it is necessary to ask if there is no other, simpler, way of accounting for the phenomenon. I think there is. It is well known that different species of animals vary greatly in the acuteness of their senses. To man, sight is the most important sense, and the same is true of many other animals, and most birds. The cat is a representative of another, smaller, class of animals, whose most perfect organ of sense is the ear; while the dog lives in a world of sensations, the most important of which are contributed by the sense of smell. To this last class bel ngs the rat, which is noted for the acuteness of its scent. It is evident, therefore, that the water-rat in question was led to the window-sill by his nose, which, in his case, was a more trustworthy guide than his eyes would have been. I do not wish to deny, by any means, that animals have reasoning powers. On the contrary, I am convinced that human and brute intellect differ only in degree, not in kind; and I even adopt Haeckel's \u201ccellular psychology,\u201d which attributes the elements of intellectual life\u2014sensation and volition\u2014to infusoria and organic cells in general, in opposition to the older \u201cneural psychology,\u201d according to which psychic activity begins with the nervous system in the scale of animal life. But what we have to guard against is not to ascribe to animals reasoning powers of a higher type than is consistent with the development of their brain, especially when the actions which seem to postulate such powers can be readily accounted for by simply bearing in mind the extraordinary acuteness of one or more of their senses. We are altogether too prone to judge the intellectual life of animals by the human standard, to imagine that the eye is everywhere, as with us, the leading source of knowledge; and the neglect of the important r\u00f4le which the sense of smell plays in animal life has been particularly fruitful of errors in philosophical speculation.

Sandberg has published the details of the first determination of the orbit in a special treatise (Specimen Inaugurale de Orbita Comet\u00e6 II., 1867, Zwollae, 1869), which seems to be not very, much known, and it is not necessary to read much of this work to make sure of the negative value of the calculations.","dc.creator":["VALENTINER, W."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["VALENTINER, W."],"citation_author_institution":["Mannheim Observatory,"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Tempel's Comet","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Tempel&#39;s Comet&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"019508a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

PIAZZI SMYTH in his communication to NATURE, vol. xx. p. 431, evidently infers that changes in the condition of the sun must needs affect every part of the earth in the same way, whereas we have many meteorological analogies, which favour the notion that totally opposite effects may arise in different parts of the earth from the action of the same primary causes. For example, it is generally assumed that the same tropical heat which gives the primary impulse to the desiccating north-east trade wind of sub-tropical latitudes, furnishes the energy which exhibits itself in the almost constant precipitation under the equator.

PIAZZI SMYTH in his communication to NATURE, vol. xx. p. 431, evidently infers that changes in the condition of the sun must needs affect every part of the earth in the same way, whereas we have many meteorological analogies, which favour the notion that totally opposite effects may arise in different parts of the earth from the action of the same primary causes. For example, it is generally assumed that the same tropical heat which gives the primary impulse to the desiccating north-east trade wind of sub-tropical latitudes, furnishes the energy which exhibits itself in the almost constant precipitation under the equator. Any variation in the degree of this heat, should consequently affect localities situated in the region of the trades, and the equatorial calm-belt, in a diametrically opposite manner. Moreover, the notion that the British and Indian rain falls vary together now is altogether inconsistent with the well-known want of similarity between them, both as regards seasonal distribution and annual quantity in the past. It is also remarkable that while the present deluge both here and in India is traced to the sun's \u201crecovering his forces and beginning already to shine after his recent languid spotless years with increased radiation on the great oceans of the south,\u201d the rainfall of England between latitudes 50\u00b0 and 55\u00b0 N. reached a decided maximum in 1877, the year when the sun was, to adopt the favourite metaphor, affected with the most extreme languor, and has been very high all through the period of unusually marked spot minimum, from which we are but just emerging.","dc.creator":["ARCHIBALD, E.

Golofa porteri, an allied insect of the same family as Lamellicornes, behaves in a similar way, but chooses of course thinner branches.","dc.creator":["ERNST, A."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["ERNST, A."],"citation_author_institution":["Car\u00e1cas"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Dynastes Hercules","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Dynastes Hercules&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"022607b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Geikie has arrived concerning the south-west of the island apply equally to the more northerly parts. The glacier-scorings on the older lava were especially marked in a district unexplored except by a few Icelanders, and known as the Storisande or Big Sand. This desert lies to the north of Ball's Jokul and L\u00e1nge Jokul, and between Arnevatn and the River Blanda. As we crossed the undulating surface of the old lava, pale and ruddy in colour, the contrast was very striking where the black basalt seemed to rise from the plain in jagged cliffs up to the ice-field which caps these ranges.

Geikie has arrived concerning the south-west of the island apply equally to the more northerly parts. The glacier-scorings on the older lava were especially marked in a district unexplored except by a few Icelanders, and known as the Storisande or Big Sand. This desert lies to the north of Ball's Jokul and L\u00e1nge Jokul, and between Arnevatn and the River Blanda. As we crossed the undulating surface of the old lava, pale and ruddy in colour, the contrast was very striking where the black basalt seemed to rise from the plain in jagged cliffs up to the ice-field which caps these ranges. Where the sand was blown off this pale lava there were the lines of glaciation clearly engraved. The trend of the desert as a whole was towards the north, and the lines of glaciation ran north and south.

There are several heavy insect-cabinets in the room, and a loud \u201cgroan\u201d proceeded from one or more of them, indicating \u201csettling\u201d from some cause or other.

So long as the present system of teaching a single branch of natural science continues, and until the method recommended by Prof. Armstrong is adopted, it is clear that great care should be exercised in the choice of a good text-book on the particular subject selected. Even when it is found possible to teach science in the form of physiography, or Naturkunde, there will doubtless be many boys in the large schools who, having thus obtained a great amount of most valuable general knowledge and a wider view of the aims of science than is possible under the present system, will wish to carry on their studies in a particular direction. Taking chemistry, as the subject with which I am most familiar, and which at present is perhaps more widely taught than any other branch of science, it may be said that there should be no difficulty at all in selecting a suitable book. It is true that the number of textbook of chemistry is extremely large, and it is also true that there are a few books, written by men of wide knowledge and long experience in teaching, which are well adapted to the purpose in view.

I was pleased to learn that Mr. Bourne's long-expected account of Diego Garcia will soon be published. His remarks concerning the directing influence of currents agree closely with those of Semper (\u201cAnimal Life,\u201d vol. xxxi. Internat. Sci. Ser. p. 228).

Mr. Cunningham italicizes the words, \u201cthe constant repetition of this effort causes the eye gradually to move round the head till it comes to the upper side,\u201d and claims this as a Lamarckian explanation. But if we italicize the following words, which occur three lines further on, \u201cthose usually surviving whose eyes retained more and more of the position into which the young fish tried to twist them,\u201d we shall see that the survival of favourable variations is, even here, the real cause at work. For the transference of the eye to the upper side was a useful change\u2014perhaps, under the peculiar conditions of existence and development\u2014an absolutely essential one. The amount to which the eye could be twisted and retained in its new position was variable, as all other such characters are variable. Those individuals who had this faculty in the greatest degree were among those that survived, and. it is not at all necessary to assume that any portion of the change due solely to the effort was inherited, but only that those individuals which were the most favourably constituted in this respect transmitted their peculiar constitution to their offspring, and thus the twisting would take place earlier and earlier in the development of the individual Even Darwin himself, who believed in the heredity of acquired variations, says that \u201cthe tendency to distortion would no doubt be increased through the principle of inberitance\u201d; and this is really all that is necessary. In most of the higher animals symmetrical development of the two sides of the body is of vital importance, and is strictly preserved by natural selection; but more or less defect of symmetry often occurs as a variation or monstrosity, and in cases where such asymmetry was useful these variations would be preserved and increased by selection and heredity. An altogether erroneous view is taken of the fact of effort being used in this case, as if it were something unusual. But in all cases selection produces changes which are useful and whose use is often indicated by effort. The giraffe uses effort in stretching its neck to obtain food during a drought; the antelope exerts itself to the utmost to escape from the leopard; but it is now recognized that it is not the individual change produced by this effort that is inherited, but the favourable constitution which renders extreme effort unnecessary, and causes its possessors to survive while those less favourably constituted, and who therefore have to use greater effort, succumb.

But if we italicize the following words, which occur three lines further on, \u201cthose usually surviving whose eyes retained more and more of the position into which the young fish tried to twist them,\u201d we shall see that the survival of favourable variations is, even here, the real cause at work. For the transference of the eye to the upper side was a useful change\u2014perhaps, under the peculiar conditions of existence and development\u2014an absolutely essential one. The amount to which the eye could be twisted and retained in its new position was variable, as all other such characters are variable. Those individuals who had this faculty in the greatest degree were among those that survived, and. it is not at all necessary to assume that any portion of the change due solely to the effort was inherited, but only that those individuals which were the most favourably constituted in this respect transmitted their peculiar constitution to their offspring, and thus the twisting would take place earlier and earlier in the development of the individual Even Darwin himself, who believed in the heredity of acquired variations, says that \u201cthe tendency to distortion would no doubt be increased through the principle of inberitance\u201d; and this is really all that is necessary. In most of the higher animals symmetrical development of the two sides of the body is of vital importance, and is strictly preserved by natural selection; but more or less defect of symmetry often occurs as a variation or monstrosity, and in cases where such asymmetry was useful these variations would be preserved and increased by selection and heredity. An altogether erroneous view is taken of the fact of effort being used in this case, as if it were something unusual. But in all cases selection produces changes which are useful and whose use is often indicated by effort. The giraffe uses effort in stretching its neck to obtain food during a drought; the antelope exerts itself to the utmost to escape from the leopard; but it is now recognized that it is not the individual change produced by this effort that is inherited, but the favourable constitution which renders extreme effort unnecessary, and causes its possessors to survive while those less favourably constituted, and who therefore have to use greater effort, succumb. In the case of the developing flat-fish also, the effort indicated the direction of the useful modification, and any variations tending either to the right kind of asymmetry or to a mobility of the eye, admitting its being twisted and retained in its new position, during the growth of the individual, would be certainly preserved.","dc.creator":["WALLACE, ALFRED R."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["WALLACE, ALFRED R."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Lamarck versus Weismann","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Lamarck &lt;Emphasis Type=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;versus&lt;/Emphasis&gt;...","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"040620b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Mr. Cockerell informs me in a private communication that he has been verifying this hypothesis by observations in detail; but whether or not he will be able to establish it, I think at any rate he has done good service in thus suggesting another possibility.","dc.creator":["ROMANES, GEORGE J."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["ROMANES, GEORGE J."],"citation_author_institution":["London"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Galls","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Galls&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"041511b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

LODGE'S doctrine of the slope of potential, explained in his note to my letter in NATURE of February 19 (p. 367), still presents great difficulties. A plate of zinc is covered by a film of air or oxygen in a different state from the surrounding atmosphere. We first consider a point outside of the film. Dr. Lodge says this point is influenced by the ordinary dielectric strain of a static charge imparted to the zinc in any adventitious manner. That is evident. Now, when the zinc was isolated, we had a negative charge upon it, or in the film, and therefore, at the point in question, a positive slope of potential upwards from the zinc. Call it R. When we make contact with copper we introduce a positive static charge on to the zinc.

LODGE'S doctrine of the slope of potential, explained in his note to my letter in NATURE of February 19 (p. 367), still presents great difficulties. A plate of zinc is covered by a film of air or oxygen in a different state from the surrounding atmosphere. We first consider a point outside of the film. Dr. Lodge says this point is influenced by the ordinary dielectric strain of a static charge imparted to the zinc in any adventitious manner. That is evident. Now, when the zinc was isolated, we had a negative charge upon it, or in the film, and therefore, at the point in question, a positive slope of potential upwards from the zinc. Call it R. When we make contact with copper we introduce a positive static charge on to the zinc. The effect of this at the point in question is a negative slope of potential\u2014that is, downwards from the zinc. Call it \u2013 R\u2032. Then, as the final result we have an upward slope of potential, R \u2013 R\u2032, which is less than before contact was made.","dc.creator":["BURBURY, S.

This latter migration was south-east, and in the late autumn the steamer on Lake Mjosen made its way through thousands of these hapless wayfarers; whilst, still later, large numbers were to be seen close to Christiania; but I venture to prophesy that none will be found in that neighbourhood next year, nor, for the matter of that, in Heimdalen itself, though it is obvious that some must remain. Probably the explanation of these apparently capricious and suicidal migrations may be that they are the result of hereditary instinct, which formerly was of service if not necessary to the species. The straight course which they pursue must be owing to the sense of direction common to migrants, and I would hazard the conjecture that the changes of destination may be due to an instinct which, owing to its present inutility, is gradually diminishing in precision and intensity.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"45","prism.number":"1157","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"199","prism.endingPage":"199","prism.copyright":"1891 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/045199a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/045199a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/045199a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/045199a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Migration of the Lemming","citation_volume":"45","citation_issue":"1157","citation_publication_date":"1891/12","citation_firstpage":"199","citation_lastpage":"199","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/045199a0","DOI":"10.1038/045199a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/045199a0","description":"HAVING resided during the summer months for more than twenty years on the plateau from which the migrations of the Norwegian lemming are supposed by many to take their origin, I can speak from personal observation.

This latter migration was south-east, and in the late autumn the steamer on Lake Mjosen made its way through thousands of these hapless wayfarers; whilst, still later, large numbers were to be seen close to Christiania; but I venture to prophesy that none will be found in that neighbourhood next year, nor, for the matter of that, in Heimdalen itself, though it is obvious that some must remain. Probably the explanation of these apparently capricious and suicidal migrations may be that they are the result of hereditary instinct, which formerly was of service if not necessary to the species. The straight course which they pursue must be owing to the sense of direction common to migrants, and I would hazard the conjecture that the changes of destination may be due to an instinct which, owing to its present inutility, is gradually diminishing in precision and intensity.","dc.creator":["DUPPA-CROTCH, W."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["DUPPA-CROTCH, W."],"citation_author_institution":["Asgard, Richmond"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Migration of the Lemming","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Migration of the Lemming&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"045223c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

When I saw it I was a few miles north of the city proper, and the southern horizon was lit up by the lights in town, so that any faint display near the horizon to the south would have been obscured. I first noticed the aurora about 8.30 p.m. (75th meridian east of Greenwich time), and it continued till midnight, but was much fainter and confined to a simple glow in the north-west to north-east after about ten o'clock. When first noticed, the sky from east to west round by north was either quite deep red or reddish white. No clouds were then visible, and there were no streamers, though the glow extended about to the zenith. Then, as the red grew fainter, a few small clouds formed in the north, and the still glow was confined to the sky from east to west along the horizon, and about 50\u00b0 above it in the north, but less in the east and west. From this arch of light, streamers shot up, not only from the north but from east and west (or east by south and west by south), and met in a place about 10\u00b0 south of the zenith. These streamers pulsated rapidly, the light at times starting at the arch of (apparently) still glow and travelling without break to the point of meeting. At other times the glow would appear in places along the course of the former streamers\u2014first near the arch, then further on, disappearing again, to again appear nearer the zenith. When these rays met in the place south of the zenith, their paths sometimes crossed, but more generally the rays seemed to mingle and either form a roundish glowing spot about 5\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 across, or a roundish, confused mass of glow that looked like glowing smoke. Occasionally an appearance like a hollow-centred whirlpool appeared. When the rays met without mingling, one ray seemed to cut another off abruptly, only one ray ever appearing to pass the point of meeting. About nine o'clock, rays could be faintly seen in the south extending up to the point of meeting. Then these rays grew brighter, extending from about 30\u00b0 above the southern horizon, and throbbing up from there to the place near the zenith where the northern, eastern, and western rays met. The southern rays were fainter than the others. They may have extended further towards the horizon than 30\u00b0 above it, but, if they did, the lower part of them was too faint to be seen, on account of the city lights. I have never before seen or heard of an aurora in this latitude, with rays coming upwards from the south. The whole display seems to have been much farther south than usual.

This very distinct dingy blue and red insect is plentifully distributed in East Griqualand and Natal, especially affecting the road-cuttings between Ixopo and the Ingeli-Zuurberg mountain chain. As remarked in Mr. Roland Trimen's monograph on South African butterflies, it likes shady places under a roadside bank or rocks in a cutting; and Colonel Bowker\u2014an enthusiastic and renowed South African lepidopterist\u2014is quoted as having seen them congregated under rocks and in holes of dry banks, as many as twenty-nine being captured by placing the net over them. Their dark bronzy green under-colouring renders them, when thus massed, almost inconspicuous in association with withered fern, grass, &c., and it is only by startling them that one very often becomes aware of their presence. I particularly call to mind, while on one of my botanical rambles in the Lower Umzimkulu district of East Griqualand in 1885, accompanied by a younger son of Mr. Donald Strachan, unexpectedly flushing at least fifty of these butterflies in the cold frosty season of July, in a secluded glen of the Vubugas rivulet. Upon a iittle searching among the scrub and bush we discovered a boulder, under which there must have been as many again, if not more. These we roused out with branchlets, some being more torpid than others; but, as we retired from the spot, they all flitted back to their trysting-place. This was at the severest time of the season, and I never doubted, after having observed the massing of this butterfly at all times during the winter, that it emerged safe and strong in the ensuing spring.

Secondly, when I said that engineers had mostly to deal in their calculations with bodies either at rest or in uniform motion, I thought I was speaking in the sense of Prof. Perry's original article (he said the same thing himself near the top of column 1, page 50), and that I should have his concurrence: I would not for a moment argue such a point with him.

And lastly, although a remark immediately following his citation of a familiar electrical equation leads me to think that Prof. Perry still misses the chief point of my letter, yet there are quantities of things in the present correspondence on which we agree; and chief among them is the profound conviction we share that there is a crying need for reform in our whole system of secondary education.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"55","prism.number":"1419","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"223","prism.endingPage":"223","prism.copyright":"1897 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/055223b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/055223b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/055223b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/055223b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Pound as a Force","citation_volume":"55","citation_issue":"1419","citation_publication_date":"1897/01","citation_firstpage":"223","citation_lastpage":"223","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/055223b0","DOI":"10.1038/055223b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/055223b0","description":"A VERY few words are necessary from me in answer to Prof. Perry's letter on page 177.

This explanation, however, holds only so long as the diameter is greater than the wave-length of light. If the diameter becomes of the same order as the wave-length, the ratio between light-pressure and gravitation follows an entirely different law. This has recently been demonstrated by Prof. Schwarzschild by an exhaustive mathematical treatment of the question in a paper entitled \u201cDer Druck des Lichtes auf kleine Kugeln und die Arrhenius'sche Theorie der Cometenschweife\u201d (Sitzungsberichte der k. b. Academie der Wissenschaften zu M\u00fcnchen, 1901, Heft iii.). The conclusions arrived at in this paper are of considerable importance in so far as they show that the effect of gravitation is exceeded by that of the pressure of light only so long as the diameter of the corpuscle is greater than about 0.07.\u03bc For this limiting value the two forces are exactly balanced; but for smaller values of the diameter the light-pressure becomes rapidly less, so that it is then always exceeded by gravitation. It would appear from Prof. Schwarzschild's computations that the globular corpuscles thrown off in the tails of comets should have diameters not smaller than 0.07\u03bc and not exceeding 1.5\u03bc, supposing the specific gravity of the corpuscle to be that of water. Now these values far exceed the limits assigned to the dimensions of the molecules. According to our present knowledge, based on theory as well as on experiment, we are forced to conclude that the diameter of a molecule cannot be larger than 0.003\u03bc. On the other hand, the specific gravity of a molecule of air, for instance, appears to be very great, viz. five times that of water (see Meyer, \u201cDie kinetische Theorie der Gase\u201d). This maximum value of the diameter of a molecule is so enormously smaller than the values demanded by Prof. Arrhenius' theory that the latter appears to be incompatible with any assumption which regards the cometary matter as being of a gaseous constituency. In order to explain the repulsion of matter in the tails of comets by the pressure of the sunlight, this matter must be assumed to consist of small drops, each of a bulk sufficiently large to harbour at least one million molecules within its bounding surface. Whether such an assumption can be justified appears to me very doubtful. At any rate, Prof. Schwarzschild's profound mathematical investigation makes it absolutely clear that the idea of minute electrically-charged corpuscles\u2014of about one-thousandth the size of a hydrogen atom (see Observatory, February 1902, p. 103)\u2014being propelled by the sun's light towards the earth and causing the various phenomena of auror\u00e6, Gegenschein, &c, receives no support from the mathematical point of view. But, even apart from these difficulties, it can hardly be said that the ingenious theory of Arrhenius settles the question as to the nature of the force acting on the cometary matter. So far it offers no explanation of the remarkable phenomenon of the contraction of the coma with the approach towards the sun. Doubtless this contractile force is also of solar origin. But can it be identified with the force which repels the cometary matter in the direction of the radius vector? It appears to me that the theory in its present form only removes one difficulty by introducing several others.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"65","prism.number":"1688","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"415","prism.endingPage":"416","prism.copyright":"1902 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/065415c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/065415c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/065415c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/065415c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"On Prof. Arrhenius' Theory of Cometary Tails and Auror\u00e6","citation_volume":"65","citation_issue":"1688","citation_publication_date":"1902/03","citation_firstpage":"415","citation_lastpage":"416","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/065415c0","DOI":"10.1038/065415c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/065415c0","description":"IN the more or less popular accounts which have recently been given of Prof. Arrhenius' theory of cometary tails and the auror\u00e6, it is generally stated that the smaller the diameter of the corpuscle upon which the light is falling the greater the excess of light-pressure over gravitational force.

Freshly fused cyanin is of a deep metallic bronze colour, but exposure to light turns it plum colour and finally a steely blue-black. In the moderate light of a cloudy day the change is perceptible in half an hour, in direct sunlight in less than a minute. The complete change to blue-black requires an exposure of about twenty hours to diffuse daylight or half an hour to direct sunlight. It has long been known that cyanin is unsuitable for use as a cloth dye on account of its rapid fading in sunlight, but recent investigators of the optical properties of this substance appear to have overlooked this light effect. That the effect is purely photographic and not due to any rise in temperature is shown by the fact that long-continued heating in the dark produces no trace of discoloration. On the contrary, the effect of heating is to reverse the effect produced by the light, for a thin coating of cyanin, exposed until blue-black throughout, returns nearly to its original bronze colour on fusion or long-continued heating in the dark. By an exposure of thirty hours I have obtained on cyanin easily recognisable photographs of small, well-illuminated objects. A cyanin mirror, or better yet a piece of ground glass washed over with fused cyanin, exposed for ten hours to the spectrum of a Nernst lamp shows the effect to be very strong in the yellow, just perceptible in the adjacent red and green, and imperceptible in the blue and ultra-violet. It appears to correspond with the absorptive index as determined by Pfl\u00fcger in various parts of the spectrum. At the same time, the exposure to light greatly decreases the absorbing power where it was originally large, as may be easily seen on looking at a sodium flame or a spectrum through an exposed coating of cyanin.

An experiment which I made on a specimen of uranium salt, known to be at least thirty years old, has confirmed Mr. Soddy's conclusion so far as to show that the mean rate of production of radium could not have exceeded a hundredth part of the theoretical amount.

The quantity of work stored up in producing this strained condition, and which can be given out again when the body returns to its Un-strained condition, is analogous to the quantity of heat the body contains when at a given temperature; it is quite easy to show that we can completely represent the thermal condition of a body by means of a model consisting merely of an elastic rod subjected to a tension.

Let us take a molecular body devoid of all heat motion and plunge it into a medium the temperature of which is T. Then the medium will exert an intermittent pressure or force on the molecules, thus setting them into motion and generating heat motion in the body.

I will first state that the instruments used in England are calibrated over the whole range of conditions to which they may be exposed by placing them in a glass vessel so that they are completely covered by liquid which has been cooled to the desired temperature by solid CO2, and then exhausting the air by a pump. Thus the instrument is exposed at the same time to the conditions of pressure and temperature which it will meet with in use. This is done both before and after each ascent, unless, as sometimes happens, such damage is done by the finder as to render the second calibration impossible. On the Continent, at one station at least, and perhaps at most, the pressure is reduced slowly for the express purpose of meeting the point raised by Mr. Craig. In England, and for the same reason, air is generally left in the aneroid box.

I will first state that the instruments used in England are calibrated over the whole range of conditions to which they may be exposed by placing them in a glass vessel so that they are completely covered by liquid which has been cooled to the desired temperature by solid CO2, and then exhausting the air by a pump. Thus the instrument is exposed at the same time to the conditions of pressure and temperature which it will meet with in use. This is done both before and after each ascent, unless, as sometimes happens, such damage is done by the finder as to render the second calibration impossible. On the Continent, at one station at least, and perhaps at most, the pressure is reduced slowly for the express purpose of meeting the point raised by Mr. Craig. In England, and for the same reason, air is generally left in the aneroid box. Very thin metal is used; the box is dried, the faces are squeezed together so that they nearly touch, and the box is then sealed up. The result is that the pressure scale depends on the elasticity of the enclosed air chiefly, and only slightly on the elasticity of the metal.

It then came up, replaced the stones so as to hide the orifice, and flew away.","dc.creator":["FISHER, OSMOND"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["FISHER, OSMOND"],"citation_author_institution":["Graveley, Huntingdon"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Insect Intelligence","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Insect Intelligence&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"086381c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In epithelial cells of the Drosophila embryo, three distinct domains subdivide the lateral plasma membrane. The most apical one comprises the subapical complex (SAC). It is followed by the zonula adherens (ZA) and, further basally, by the septate junction1. A core component of the SAC is the transmembrane protein Crumbs, the cytoplasmic domain of which recruits the PDZ-protein Discs Lost into the complex2,3. Cells lacking crumbs or the functionally related gene stardust fail to organize a continuous ZA and to maintain cell polarity4,5,6.

In epithelial cells of the Drosophila embryo, three distinct domains subdivide the lateral plasma membrane. The most apical one comprises the subapical complex (SAC). It is followed by the zonula adherens (ZA) and, further basally, by the septate junction1. A core component of the SAC is the transmembrane protein Crumbs, the cytoplasmic domain of which recruits the PDZ-protein Discs Lost into the complex2,3. Cells lacking crumbs or the functionally related gene stardust fail to organize a continuous ZA and to maintain cell polarity4,5,6. Here we show that stardust provides an essential component of the SAC. Stardust proteins colocalize with Crumbs and bind to the carboxy-terminal amino acids of its cytoplasmic tail. We introduce two different Stardust proteins here: one MAGUK protein, characterized by a PDZ domain, an SH3 domain and a guanylate kinase domain; and a second isoform comprising only the guanylate kinase domain.

In addition, through their own ubiquitination, they may further contribute to the amplification of this network in the endocytic pathway.","dc.creator":["Polo, Simona","Sigismund, Sara","Faretta, Mario","Guidi, Monica","Capua, Maria Rosaria","Bossi, Giovanna","Chen, Hong","De Camilli, Pietro","Di Fiore, Pier Paolo"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Cell; citation_title=A new ticket for entry into budding vesicles\u2014ubiquitin.; citation_author=L Hicke; citation_volume=106; citation_publication_date=2001; citation_pages=527-530; citation_doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(01)00485-8; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Nature Rev.

We propose that this invisible design creates the visual appeal of the garden and was probably intended as an inherent feature of the composition.","dc.creator":["Van Tonder, Gert J.","Lyons, Michael J.","Ejima, Yoshimichi"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_title=Japanese Gardens; citation_publication_date=1993; citation_id=CR1; citation_author=G Nitschke","citation_journal_title=J.

An intriguing refinement of this technique has now been discovered. The tiny wasp Trichogramma brassicae intercepts an anti-aphrodisiac passed from male to female large white butterflies during mating, to make them less attractive to rival males. A wasp detecting the odour of a mated female butterfly first hitches a ride, then parasitizes the new-laid eggs. This strategy, if widespread, could severely limit the evolution of sexual communication between hosts. To locate their hosts, parasitic wasps can \u2018eavesdrop\u2019 on the intraspecific chemical communications of their insect hosts1,2,3.

Our studies also suggest that the inherent developmental potential of stem cells isolated from diverse tissues or organs may be more similar than previously anticipated.","dc.creator":["Gussoni, Emanuela","Soneoka, Yuko","Strickland, Corinne D.","Buzney, Elizabeth A.","Khan, Mohamed K.","Flint, Alan F.","Kunkel, Louis M.","Mulligan, Richard C."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Science; citation_title=The basic science of gene therapy.; citation_author=RC Mulligan; citation_volume=260; citation_publication_date=1993; citation_pages=926-932; citation_doi=10.1126/science.8493530; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Science; citation_title=The molecular basis of muscular dystrophy in the mdx mouse: a point mutation.; citation_author=P Sicinski; citation_volume=244; citation_publication_date=1989; citation_pages=1578-1580; citation_doi=10.1126/science.2662404; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Cell; citation_title=Nuclear domains in muscle cells.; citation_author=ZW Hall, EA Ralston; citation_volume=59; citation_publication_date=1989; citation_pages=771-772; citation_doi=10.1016/0092-8674(89)90597-7; citation_id=CR3","citation_journal_title=Am.

We propose that, through these interactions, nuclear-pore complexes organize a nuclear subdomain that is intimately involved in the regulation of chromatin metabolism.","dc.creator":["Galy, Vincent","Olivo-Marin, Jean-Christophe","Scherthan, Harry","Doye, Valerie","Rascalou, Nadia","Nehrbass, Ulf"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Genes Dev.; citation_title=Evidence for silencing compartments within the yeast nucleus: a role for telomere proximity and Sir protein concentration in silencer-mediated repression.; citation_author=L Maillet; citation_volume=10; citation_publication_date=1996; citation_pages=1796-1811; citation_doi=10.1101/gad.10.14.1796; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=Perinuclear localization of chromatin facilitates transcriptional silencing.; citation_author=ED Andrulis, AM Neiman, DC Zappulia, R Sternglanz; citation_volume=394; citation_publication_date=1998; citation_pages=592-595; citation_doi=10.1038/29100; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Cell; citation_title=Position effect at S. cerevisiae telomeres: reversible repression of Pol II transcription.; citation_author=DE Gottschling, OM Aparicio, BL Billington, VA Zakian; citation_volume=63; citation_publication_date=1990; citation_pages=751-762; citation_doi=10.1016/0092-8674(90)90141-Z; citation_id=CR3","citation_journal_title=J.

Furthermore, circulating transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21) is increased following liver damage and may promote endothelial cell permeability. This study aimed to assess whether increased circulating TGF\u03b21 drives changes in tight junction protein expression and MMP9 activity following acute liver failure. Blood\u2013brain barrier permeability was assessed in azoxymethane (AOM)-treated mice at 6, 12, and 18\u2009h post-injection via Evan\u2019s blue extravasation. Monolayers of immortalized mouse brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3) were treated with recombinant TGF\u03b21 (rTGF\u03b21) and permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-dextran), MMP9 and claudin-5 expression was assessed. Antagonism of TGF\u03b21 signaling was performed in vivo to determine its role in blood\u2013brain barrier permeability. Blood\u2013brain barrier permeability was increased in mice at 18\u2009h following AOM injection. Treatment of bEnd.3 cells with rTGF\u03b21 led to a dose-dependent increase of MMP9 expression as well as a suppression of claudin-5 expression. These effects of rTGF\u03b21 on MMP9 and claudin-5 expression could be reversed following treatment with a SMAD3 inhibitor. AOM-treated mice injected with neutralizing antibodies against TGF\u03b2 demonstrated significantly reduced blood\u2013brain barrier permeability. Blood\u2013brain barrier permeability is induced in AOM mice via a mechanism involving the TGF\u03b21-driven SMAD3-dependent upregulation of MMP9 expression and decrease of claudin-5 expression.

In thin transparent films, laser interactions confined to the film/substrate interface have underpinned blistering and ejection processes for nanofluidic channel fabrication, film patterning and cell catapulting. Here, we harness femtosecond lasers to drive nonlinear interactions within Fabry\u2013Perot interference fringes to define narrow nanolength scale zones for highly resolved internal structuring of a film of refractive index, nfilm, at fringe maxima separated by \u03bb/2nfilm. This novel interaction internally cleaves the film to open subwavelength internal cavities and form thin membranes at single or multiple depths from which follow significant opportunities for writing multilevel nanofluidic channels inside the film, as well as ejecting nanodisks at quantized film depths for coloring and three-dimensional surface patterning that promise new compact types of lab-in-film devices. High-resolution structuring of thin transparent films using a femtosecond laser can aid the fabrication of various devices. Kitty Kumar and co-workers from the University of Toronto in Canada say that interference from reflections at the film\u2019s boundaries causes the laser light to create a series of periodic plasma disks in the dielectric film that eject material.

In thin transparent films, laser interactions confined to the film/substrate interface have underpinned blistering and ejection processes for nanofluidic channel fabrication, film patterning and cell catapulting. Here, we harness femtosecond lasers to drive nonlinear interactions within Fabry\u2013Perot interference fringes to define narrow nanolength scale zones for highly resolved internal structuring of a film of refractive index, nfilm, at fringe maxima separated by \u03bb/2nfilm. This novel interaction internally cleaves the film to open subwavelength internal cavities and form thin membranes at single or multiple depths from which follow significant opportunities for writing multilevel nanofluidic channels inside the film, as well as ejecting nanodisks at quantized film depths for coloring and three-dimensional surface patterning that promise new compact types of lab-in-film devices. High-resolution structuring of thin transparent films using a femtosecond laser can aid the fabrication of various devices. Kitty Kumar and co-workers from the University of Toronto in Canada say that interference from reflections at the film\u2019s boundaries causes the laser light to create a series of periodic plasma disks in the dielectric film that eject material. The resulting laser-generated nanovoids could be useful for fabricating miniature cavities and fluidic waveguides or performing nanoscale texturing to improve light harvesting in solar cells or light extraction from LEDs.

However, the traditional design strategy of a multifocal metalens combines several lenses that have different focal points into a planar integrated unit, resulting in low imaging quality because of the high background noise. Here we show that the defects of the traditional method can be overcome by designing a metalens with conic shapes (the ellipse and the hyperbola); this approach could improve the imaging performance and substantially decrease the background noise of multifocal metalenses. These benefits arise from the intrinsic properties of the two conic curves, which can focus incident light constructively at all of the foci of the metalens. We further demonstrate that the proposed conic-shaped metalens can function well within a broadband operation wavelength that ranges from 600 to 900\u2009nm with the dual polarity actively controlled by the incident circular polarized light. The great agreement between the experimental and simulation results demonstrates that our proposed metalens has significant potential for use in future integrated nanophotonic devices. Flat lenses that can focus light to multiple points depending on its polarization have been fabricated by scientists in China. Multifocal lenses, which focus incident light with different properties at multiple foci, are widely used in imaging systems and optical communications. They are usually fabricated by combining several lenses with different focal lengths, but this creates background noise that reduces imaging quality. Now, Zheyu Fang and colleagues from Peking University have overcome this problem by using so-called metalenses\u2014thin films perforated with arrays of subwavelength holes.
