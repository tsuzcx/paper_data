Among the 4,000 members there are not a dozen who are not aware of this.","dc.creator":["X"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["X"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The British Medical Association","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The British Medical Association&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"002396a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

WALLACE'S frank acknowledgment, for which I thank him, that he had in his two previous letters misunderstood my line of argument in what I consider one of the most important points at issue between us, absolves me from the task of again defending myself from charges of error and self-contradiction. As, moreover, Mr. Wallace has not accepted my challenge \u201cto explain the nature of the intelligence which was operative in the creation of man, and which is a principle unknown in the rest of the organic world,\u201d it is impossible to pursue further this branch of the question. All naturalists will look forward with the most intense interest to Mr. Darwin's long-promised work on Natural Selection as applied to Man. There are, however, one or two subsidiary points raised in the discussion, to which I shall be glad of the opportunity of briefly referring. Mr. Stebbing, objecting to my attempted parallelism between mimicry and instinct, says that \u201cit can hardly be said to be proved\u201d that the extraordinary resemblances occasionally found in the vegetable kingdom are not protective or mimetic.

WALLACE'S frank acknowledgment, for which I thank him, that he had in his two previous letters misunderstood my line of argument in what I consider one of the most important points at issue between us, absolves me from the task of again defending myself from charges of error and self-contradiction. As, moreover, Mr. Wallace has not accepted my challenge \u201cto explain the nature of the intelligence which was operative in the creation of man, and which is a principle unknown in the rest of the organic world,\u201d it is impossible to pursue further this branch of the question. All naturalists will look forward with the most intense interest to Mr. Darwin's long-promised work on Natural Selection as applied to Man. There are, however, one or two subsidiary points raised in the discussion, to which I shall be glad of the opportunity of briefly referring. Mr. Stebbing, objecting to my attempted parallelism between mimicry and instinct, says that \u201cit can hardly be said to be proved\u201d that the extraordinary resemblances occasionally found in the vegetable kingdom are not protective or mimetic. I certainly think it can be. When we find an almost absolute identity between the foliage of a plant belonging to Africa and another growing in South America,* we are certainly justified in saying that one has not imitated the other, and that it gains no protection from the resemblance.

At 6 o'clock the sky was clear, except a cloud of deep rose aurora over Orion, and another detached portion toward the west. This soon developed into a cloudy arch of the same colour stretching from east to west; then, a little south of the zenith between the Pleiades and Aldebaran, this arch culminated to an obtuse point of white cloud, something like a broad gothic arch. The northern half of the heavens was quite clear, but a series of radiations towards the south, and spreading east and west, issued from this point. For some time it seemed doubtful whether it was aurora, or a peculiar appearance of the clouds caused by high air currents, and a refraction of light from the sun's rays in the higher regions of the atmosphere. At one time there was some appearance of spiral radiations, or drift of cloud from this point near the zenith, with a distinct but irregular gap of clear sky, somewhat similar to the Coalhole in the galaxy near the Southern Cross; but this did not last long, although the general appearance was continued for more than half an hour, with varying play of light, over a space of about 140\u00b0 of the southern heavens, with pretty well-defined eastern and western boundaries of deep rose colour, culminating in the white focus near the Pleiades, which appeared the centre of action. The rose colour was chiefly confined to the eastern and western boundaries, with intermitting starts of whitish radiation toward the south. Occasionally well-defined streaks of a lighter tint crossed the western portion of the rosy cloud, which appeared to originate from the light of the sun, now, of course, far below the horizon. At length the eastern portion became less brilliant, but still Orion was enveloped in a steady rosy haze, although it gradually became fainter, until, a little before 7 o'clock, the rosy colour below Orion toward the eastern horizon became as brilliant as ever, and soon a straight broad ray of rose colour started up from the horizon. This was not curved or arched, like the whiter radiations which seemed to originate from near the zenith; nor was it, like them, intermittent and wavy; but had the appearance of a broad beam of rosy light originating below the horizon, and darting straight upward in a diagonal direction, proceeding over Castor and Pollux and Jupiter. Then the north side of this became of a peculiar light bluish green; if I may be allowed to coin a word, it was of a moonshiny colour. If the moon had been a few days younger, I should have thought it originated from the moon. This very peculiar and distinct broad beam or bar of light almost developed prismatic colours from its southern rosy edge to its northern bluish-green well defined border. There was also a somewhat indistinct tendency to the same prismatic appearance, spreading some little distance over the heavens on the south side of this beam near the zenith. The northern segment of the sky from Castor and Pollux to about direct west was still perfectly clear, both from cloud and aurora, right down to the horizon; there was a bank of cloud along the southern horizon. About 7 o'clock there was an appearance of rosy tint to the north of the peculiar straight bank spoken of, and this reached as far as the pointers in the Great Bear. About the same time there was a peculiar development of white cloud from the zenith toward the north-west, streaked and fringed with well defined radiations, and this gradually increased until the northern portion of the heavens, which had hitherto been quite clear, was covered to within 30\u00b0 of the horizon, the border of this cloud being very distinctly and deeply serrated with fan-like shapes radiating from near the zenith. The phenomena I have described occupied more than an hour, and my attention was now drawn from it until after 8 o'clock, when the whole heavens were cloudy, but behind and between the clouds the rosy tint was still visible as an irregular arch stretching from north to west. As the clouds broke off the whitish wavy radiation could be occasionally seen still issuing from near the zenith, and across the western part of the rosy arch were occasionally seen the straight diagonal bars of a brighter shade, apparently caused by the light of the sun, but the clouds obscured most of the phenomena. At a last look near 9 o'clock the clouds had somewhat cleared, and there were two brilliant arches, more like the regular aurora from the northwest horizon towards the zenith, at right angles to the more cloudy arch, which had been visible for some time stretching from the north to the west.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"5","prism.number":"119","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"284","prism.endingPage":"284","prism.copyright":"1872 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/005284b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/005284b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/005284b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/005284b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Aurora Borealis of Feb. 4th","citation_volume":"5","citation_issue":"119","citation_publication_date":"1872/02","citation_firstpage":"284","citation_lastpage":"284","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/005284b0","DOI":"10.1038/005284b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/005284b0","description":"LAST evening (Sunday, Feb. 4) there was a brilliant display of aurora visible in North Devon with some unusual features.

I possess an English mastiff, by name Kepler, a son of the celebrated Turk out of Venus. I brought the dog, when six weeks old, from the stable in which he was born. The first time I took him out he started back in alarm at the first butcher's shop he had ever seen. I soon found he had a violent antipathy to butchers and butchers' shops. When six months old, a servant took him with her on an errand. At a short distance before coming to the house, she had to pass a butcher's shop; the dog threw himself down (being led with a string), and neither coaxing nor threats would make him pass the shop. The dog was too heavy to be carried; and as a crowd collected, the servant had to return with the dog more than a mile, and then go without him. This occurred about two years ago. The antipathy still continues, but the dog will pass nearer to a shop than he formerly would. About two months ago, in a little book on dogs published by Dean, I discovered that the same strange antipathy is shown by the father, Turk. I then wrote to Mr. Nichols, the former owner of Turk, to ask him for any information he might have on the point. He replied\u2014\u2018I can say that the same antipathy exists in King, the sire of Turk, in Turk, in Punch (son of Turk, out of Meg) and in Paris (son of Turk, out of Juno). Paris has the greatest antipathy, as he would hardly go into a street where a butcher's shop is, and would run away after passing it. When a cart with a butcher's man came into the place where the dogs were kept, although they could not see him, they all were ready to break their chains. A master-butcher, dressed privately, called one evening on Paris's master to see the dog. He had hardly entered the house before the dog (though shut in) was so much excited that he had to be put into a shed, and the butcher was forced to leave without seeing the dog. The same dog at Hastings made a spring at a gentleman who came into the hotel. The owner caught the dog and apologised, and said he never knew him to do so before, except when a butcher came to his house. The gentleman at once said that was his business.

This led to a letter from Mr. J. C. Costerus (vol. xiii. p. 427), calling attention to the results obtained by Askenasy, published in 1876, who found that some kinds were changed in colour, and some not changed. In the autumn of 1873 I made a number of experiments on this subject, and published a short account of them in the same year in the Quarterly Journal of Science, vol. iii. p. 474. I came to the same conclusion as Askenasy has come to, and was also able to establish some important generalisations. I will only mention a few special instances. I was unable to cause any change in the colour of the common Orange Lily (Lilium aurantiacum), whereas I found that a very considerable change was produced in the case of Erysimum Peroffskianum by only a moderate degree of darkness. This may perhaps be owing to the fact that the orange tint of these two kinds of flowers is due to entirely different substances. That of the lily is due to what I have called orange xanthophyll, whereas that of the other flower is due to a much less stable compound, giving an entirely different spectrum, met with also in the orange marigold, and therefore named by me Calendula xanthine. Comparing together the mixed colouring matters found in an equal weight of the petals, I found that the amount of the Calendula xanthine was only half as great in the petals grown in the dark, whereas the more yellow constituents were reduced only to three-quarters, so that the general colour was more yellow. I found that a similar change could be produced in the case of the marigold. If shaded when the flowers are somewhat grown, the total colour may be very considerably reduced without there being any material change in the ratios of the different colouring matters, whereas when grown in the dark from a very small bud, the ratios are changed, as in the case of Erysimum. Growing flowers in the dark seems to stop the normal development to a greater or less extent according to the nature of the colouring-matters, the effect being the greatest in the case of those substances which are the most easily decomposed. We thus find what appears at first sight to be a very unlikely result, viz., that those constituents which, when dissolved out from the petals, are the most easily discolorised by exposure to light, are formed in relatively greater amount when the flowers are grown in the light, which is easily explained if we assume that a higher vital power, depending on the presence of light, is necessary to overcome the more powerful chemical affinities of the less stable compounds.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"13","prism.number":"337","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"465","prism.endingPage":"465","prism.copyright":"1876 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/013465b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/013465b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/013465b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/013465b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Colour of Flowers Grown in the Dark","citation_volume":"13","citation_issue":"337","citation_publication_date":"1876/04","citation_firstpage":"465","citation_lastpage":"465","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/013465b0","DOI":"10.1038/013465b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/013465b0","description":"IN NATURE, vol. xiii. p. 348, Mr. Thiselton Dyer gives an extract from Sachs's \u201cText-book of Botany\u201d to the effect that no change is produced in the colour of flowers by growing them in the dark.

Too much importance cannot, I think, be given in this connection, to the principle of economy of nutrition, or balancement of growth, formulated by Aristotle, in the words \u201c\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03bd\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c7\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03b9\u03c3 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03c3 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03c3 \u03b1\u03b4\u03bd\u03c5\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd  \u03b7 \u03c0\u03bd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c3,\u201d and by Goethe, in the expression \u201cNature, in order to spend on one side, is forced to economise on the other.\u201d I gave one example of this law in a previous letter (NATURE, vol. xiii. p. 107) in speaking of the indirect uses of the waste, or secondary products of metastasis in plants; but as the subject is admirably sketched in Mr. Lowne's suggestive essay on \u201cThe Philosophy of Evolution,\u201d a work too little known or appreciated, I will give here an outline of the argument. Food may be divided into three parts\u2014for nutrition, for the production of energy and waste, or excretion. In many lower organisms the excreted material forms a simple shell; in plants manna, nectar, and resins belong to this group. The chief form of energy in the organic kingdom is that resulting from the oxidation of carbon, chiefly characteristic of animals, while plants secrete the energy-producing material. In higher organisms it is physiologically advantageous that the parts of an organism should differ in the kind of nourishment they require and thus act, as Sir James Paget has shown, as excretory organs to one another. Thus all animals which feed on large quantities of comparatively slightly nutritious matter have a complicated digestive apparatus, and a strong tendency to the production of large skeletons or cutaneous organs, which relieve the special excretory organs. The stag applies a large portion of the calcareous salts derived from the herbage to the production of horns in the male and the bones of the young in the female. The thoracic appendages of the lamellicorns and the beaks of the toucan and horn-bill are given as further examples, and \u201cthe dermal appendages of reptiles and the feathers of birds, rich in pigment and nitrogen are probably entirely excrementitious to the other tissues.\u201d Mr. Lowne makes an interesting final application of this hypothesis to the loss of the hairy covering of the human skin, it being the albuminous tissue most easily dispensed with to nourish the highly developed nervous system. \u201cPhosphorus was likewise required in large quantities and the osseous system became reduced in size.\u201d The composition of the nutrient fluid of the organism remaining constant, the excreted matter will be so also, and thus, for example, a rudimentary horn or a pigment may be produced by a change of food and preserved, while the food remains the same, by a physiological selection, as preventing the overtaxing of the kidneys, before sexual selection or protective selection come into play. I have an instance in point before me. Two plants of variegated kale under the influence of the late drought have produced axial structures from the midribs and veins of all their leaves, and I have no doubt that were their seedlings grown under similar nutritive conditions, a race of plants thus substituting fibro-vascular tissue for the usually abnormal development of parenchyma in the kale would be produced.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"14","prism.number":"358","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"393","prism.endingPage":"393","prism.copyright":"1876 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/014393a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/014393a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/014393a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/014393a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Origin of Variations","citation_volume":"14","citation_issue":"358","citation_publication_date":"1876/09","citation_firstpage":"393","citation_lastpage":"393","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/014393a0","DOI":"10.1038/014393a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/014393a0","description":"THERE is a slight difference between all three of the answers to Mr. Murphy's queries on Protective Mimicry (vol. xiv. pp. 309, 329); but, I think, the authors of those replies are unanimously over-hasty to call in the aid of protective selection.

The thoracic appendages of the lamellicorns and the beaks of the toucan and horn-bill are given as further examples, and \u201cthe dermal appendages of reptiles and the feathers of birds, rich in pigment and nitrogen are probably entirely excrementitious to the other tissues.\u201d Mr. Lowne makes an interesting final application of this hypothesis to the loss of the hairy covering of the human skin, it being the albuminous tissue most easily dispensed with to nourish the highly developed nervous system. \u201cPhosphorus was likewise required in large quantities and the osseous system became reduced in size.\u201d The composition of the nutrient fluid of the organism remaining constant, the excreted matter will be so also, and thus, for example, a rudimentary horn or a pigment may be produced by a change of food and preserved, while the food remains the same, by a physiological selection, as preventing the overtaxing of the kidneys, before sexual selection or protective selection come into play. I have an instance in point before me. Two plants of variegated kale under the influence of the late drought have produced axial structures from the midribs and veins of all their leaves, and I have no doubt that were their seedlings grown under similar nutritive conditions, a race of plants thus substituting fibro-vascular tissue for the usually abnormal development of parenchyma in the kale would be produced.","dc.creator":["BOULGER, G.

Obviously man could do no more under the same conditions.","dc.creator":["NICOLS, ARTHUR"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["NICOLS, ARTHUR"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Intellect in Brutes","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Intellect in Brutes&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"019409c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Nield, giving an interesting description of unique, or nearly unique, appearances in the boulder clay near Oldham. It appears that this glacial deposit has one or more beds of peat, or fragments of peat, intercalated along with it at various depths, leading to the inference that the day had been stirred up and the fragments of peat had in some manner been mixed with it. That peat bogs, or surface black peaty mould, had existed at no great distance is a conclusion forced upon us, and that the action of ice and snow, probably during a submergence, had mashed up the clay and distributed the peat amongst it. The boulder clay, and the scratched mountain sides, and the travelled fragments of rock, do not extend over the whole of England. It used to be said by geologists that the effects of a severe Arctic climate could not be detected south of a line drawn across the country from London to Bristol; by which it was inferred that all the land north of that line had been under water, subject to the influences of snow and floating icebergs, and all the country South of it above water and clear of those influences. Since then the large granite boulder on the shore of Barnstaple Bay, estimated to weigh ten tons, has been brought more prominently under our notice by Mr. W. Pengelly (Trans. Dev. Assoc. vi. 211), and several others by Mr. T. M. Hall (ld. xi. 429), discovered by excavation. All these are travelled blocks, and probably ice-borne. Many attempts have been made by ardent and intelligent students of late years to detect proofs of glacial action further south, and even to the shores of the British Channel, but hitherto with doubtful success. There lies on the greensand of Haldon, near Exeter, and on the Blackdown Hills, stretching away towards the south-east corner of the county of Devon, a stratum of tough yellow clay full of white flints, mostly angular. About Haldon and eastward over Pitminster and Churchstanton, many white quartz rounded pebbles, foreign to the accompanying beds, are met with. Farther south, between Honiton and the sea, this stratum of flints and clay in some places is seen to be from forty to fifty feet thick, and the best section of it is in the gravel pits near the cliff on Peak Hill, on the west of Sidmouth. By some persons this deposit has been regarded as the thinned-out edge of the plastic clay formation, containing the remaining flints of the washed-out chalk, still found more perfect at Beer Head, a few miles east. Whether it was this, or whether it was a boulder clay, so called, it is well to remark that, though thickest on the flat tops of the hills, it seems to lap down over their sides, as if it had been deposited after the valleys and the elevations had come to their present conformation; and at two places at least to be visible in the valley of Sidmouth\u2014one under the great blocks of breccia in the orchard near the brook on the Boomer or Boughmoor Estate, and the other on a subordinate hill in a grass field, at about 200 yards from Jenny Pine's Corner, walking down the new road towards Cotmaton, and on the right-hand side. Most of this latter patch of clay and flints was dug away two or three years ago to assist in forming the new road.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"22","prism.number":"573","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"583","prism.endingPage":"584","prism.copyright":"1880 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/022583f0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/022583f0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/022583f0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/022583f0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"A Peat Bed in the Drift at Oldham","citation_volume":"22","citation_issue":"573","citation_publication_date":"1880/10","citation_firstpage":"583","citation_lastpage":"584","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/022583f0","DOI":"10.1038/022583f0","citation_doi":"10.1038/022583f0","description":"IN NATURE, vol. xxii. p. 460, there is a letter by Mr. Jas.

Its greatest severity seems to have been felt at the Armenian village of Teghourt, lying at the foot of the Nimroud Dagh, at a distance, judging by eye, of not more than four miles from the edge of the crater. This village has been almost entirely destroyed, with the loss of ninety-three lives. By the same shock about 200 houses were thrown down or more or less damaged in the aggregation of hamlets named Akhlat, some six or seven miles further distant from the Nimroud Dagh. Here however happily only two lives were lost and a few persons were injured. On June 9, in the evening, a second shock took place of less violence, which partially damaged a third village, Sipratzor, lying between the other two. As far as I was able to learn these villages were the only localities in which buildings were actually thrown down, though cracks were caused in walls, &c, in other places. The three villages are all in the direct line between the two great extinct volcanoes of the Nimroud Dagh and Sipan Dagh, which fact leads to the conjecture that there may be a line of least resistance joining the two mountains. All three villages, however, are nearer to Nimroud than to Sipan. The greater severity of the shock at Teghourt, the nearest village to Nimroud, may have been due to the latter having been the centre of the disturbance, but it may also have been caused by the fact that the village is built directly upon the solid rock of an ancient lava-bed. The only observation I was able to obtain of the direction of the earthquake wave was communicated to me at a village lying due east of the Nimroud Dagh. Here it was said that the wave came from the south, which would look as if the centre of disturbance were in the Central Kurdistan mountains, not in Nimroud; but one doubtful observation is of course not enough to establish such a point.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"24","prism.number":"611","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"238","prism.endingPage":"238","prism.copyright":"1881 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/024238b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/024238b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/024238b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/024238b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Earthquake in Van","citation_volume":"24","citation_issue":"611","citation_publication_date":"1881/07","citation_firstpage":"238","citation_lastpage":"238","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/024238b0","DOI":"10.1038/024238b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/024238b0","description":"SINCE my former letter I have had an opportunity of visiting the region most affected by the earthquake of May 30, and have obtained some further particulars about it.

Here it was said that the wave came from the south, which would look as if the centre of disturbance were in the Central Kurdistan mountains, not in Nimroud; but one doubtful observation is of course not enough to establish such a point.","dc.creator":["CLAYTON, EMILIUS"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["CLAYTON, EMILIUS"],"citation_author_institution":["Van, Turkey-in-Asia"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Earthquake in Van","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Earthquake in Van&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"024261a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Mr. Meek's species has hitherto been the only known member of the genus, either fossil or recent, and was only known to occur in the strata of the Laramie group, an extensive brackish water formation in Western North America, which holds a transitional position between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic series. Associated with Pyrgulifera humerosa, among various other fresh and brackish water forms, is one that I have described under the name of Goniobasis cleburni, which is evidently congeneric with the Melania (Sermyla) admirabilis of Smith, an associate of Pyrgulifera damoni and P. crassigranulata in Lake Tanganyika. As that lake has evidently once been a brackish water sea, it is not strange that there should be certain similarities between its molluscan fauna and the faun\u00e6 of similar bodies of water that existed in Mesozoic and Cenozoic time. It is, however, remark able that the two generic types here especially referred to should appear in their integrity living in Africa, and not in North America, where the fossil forms occur; and especially so because so many of the fresh-water and land-molluscan types now living on the latter continent are found fossil in its Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"25","prism.number":"631","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"101","prism.endingPage":"102","prism.copyright":"1881 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/025101b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/025101b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/025101b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/025101b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Tanganyika Shells","citation_volume":"25","citation_issue":"631","citation_publication_date":"1881/12","citation_firstpage":"101","citation_lastpage":"102","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/025101b0","DOI":"10.1038/025101b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/025101b0","description":"IN the Proc.

BALL says very truly that the fundamental question is, what traces of great tides ought we to expect to find if those great tides had really existed? Mr. Darwin says, coarse-grained rocks, and different forms of vegetation calculated to resist the action of the accompanying great winds. Mr. Ball, in reply, remarks that high tides in the Avon are accompanied by fine sediment. He thinks with others that the high tides would have produced a vastly greater amount of sediment than is being formed at present. I quite agree with Mr. Ball about the fine sediment, but I am not at all clear that high tides mean great marine denudation. By far the largest portion of the work done by the sea as a denuding agent is due not to the wearing action of currents, or to the pounding of materials on a beach at low water, but to the direct action of the sea on the cliffs. This force is estimated as about a ton per square foot on the average in winter, on the west coast of Great Britain. This undermines the cliff at the sea level, and then the top part falls partly by its own weight, but still more through the effect of the air compressed in the caves and cracks, which by its elasticity spread the blow over a very large surface through the crack and joints of the rock. Now to undermine cliffs with a given force of wind and wave, it seems clear that the maximum effect would be produced where the tides are very small, for there the force is constantly applied at the same spot. With a rise and fall of 100 feet, each portion of the cliff would be subjected to the force of the waves for so short a time that in all probability caves would never be formed at all, and the height of the tide would be an actual protection to the land. As a matter of fact, those places where the tides are highest show, as far as I know, no signs of excessive denudations. I spent two days last year on the Bay of Fundy, where the tides are higher than anywhere in the world, and I was very much struck with the absence of any evidence of great denudation due to the tide. The cliffs at the Joggias are about high-water mark, with a long beach which slopes very gradually. The force of the waves, such as they are, is spent in hammering this beach and grinding it into fine sand and mud; the mud is carried about in suspension by the tide, and the sand is shifted about, but the denuding effect is exceedingly small. The consequence is that the cliffs are pounded by the waves for such a short time each tide that they suffer mainly from atmospheric denudation, the sea doing little more than keeping their base clear, and in many places not even doing that.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"27","prism.number":"688","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"222","prism.endingPage":"222","prism.copyright":"1883 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/027222a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/027222a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/027222a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/027222a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"On the Occurrence of Great Tides since the Commencement of the Geological Epoch","citation_volume":"27","citation_issue":"688","citation_publication_date":"1883/01","citation_firstpage":"222","citation_lastpage":"222","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/027222a0","DOI":"10.1038/027222a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/027222a0","description":"MR.

Indeed no other planet appears to be so favourably circumstanced in this respect, for the chief markings on Mars have been perceptible with the same definiteness of outline and characteristics of form through many succeeding generations, whereas the features such as we discern on the other planets are either temporary atmospheric phenomena or rendered so indistinct by unfavourable conditions as to defy lengthened observation. Moreover it may be taken for granted that the features of Mars are permanent objects on the actual surface of the planet, whereas the markings displayed by our telescopes on some of the other planetary members of our system are mere effects of atmospheric changes which, though visible for several years and showing well-defined periods of rotation, cannot be accepted as affording the true periods. The behaviour of the red spot on Jupiter may closely intimate the actual motion of the sphere of that planet, but markings of such variable unstable character can hardly exhibit an exact conformity of motion with the surface upon which they are seen to be projected. With respect to Mars the case is entirely different. No substantial changes in the most conspicuous features have been detected since they were first confronted with telescopic power, and we do not anticipate that in future ages there will be any material difference in their general configurations.

These may possibly be due to atmospheric effects on the planet itself, but in many cases the alleged variations have doubtless been more imaginary than real. The changes in our own climate are so rapid and striking, and occasion such abnormal appearances in celestial objects that we are frequently led to infer actual changes where none have taken place; in fact, observers cannot be too careful to consider the origin of such differences and to look nearer home for some of the discordances which may have become apparent in their results.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"30","prism.number":"759","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"55","prism.endingPage":"56","prism.copyright":"1884 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/030055c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/030055c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/030055c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/030055c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Rotation Period of Mars","citation_volume":"30","citation_issue":"759","citation_publication_date":"1884/05","citation_firstpage":"55","citation_lastpage":"56","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/030055c0","DOI":"10.1038/030055c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/030055c0","description":"NOTWITHSTANDING his comparatively small diameter and slow axial motion, the planet Mars affords special facilities for the exact determination of the rotation period.

The changes in our own climate are so rapid and striking, and occasion such abnormal appearances in celestial objects that we are frequently led to infer actual changes where none have taken place; in fact, observers cannot be too careful to consider the origin of such differences and to look nearer home for some of the discordances which may have become apparent in their results.","dc.creator":["DENNING, W.

At 5.6 a belt of orange-colour lay on the horizon near the point of sunset, having a breadth of 4\u00b0. From this base shot up the bluish-white cone, while on each side (south-west and north-west and skirting the horizon) the sky had a smoky-brown aspect. The whole was overtopped by an arch of a pale smoky-pink hue, the outer circumference of which reached an altitude of about 30\u00b0 as measured from the horizon. At 5.8 the bluish-white cone had become more intense, and the eastern sky was of a pale green. At 5.12 the bluish-white cone, with brown sides and orange base, was very distinct. At 5.14 I noted a long ellipse of intensely blue sky, the meridian forming its major diameter.

Probably the whole tract from green to violet inclusive was repeated, but I could only make out those two colours distinctly.","dc.creator":["CROFT, CHARLES"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["CROFT, CHARLES"],"citation_author_institution":["Prestwich, near Manchester"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Rainbow Phenomenon","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Rainbow Phenomenon&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"032103b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Indeed, the observation of these secondary currents preceded and led to the construction of the primary cells with solid electrolytes which I have recently described.","dc.creator":["BIDWELL, SHELFORD"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["BIDWELL, SHELFORD"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Solid Electrolytes","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;Emphasis Type=&quot;Bold&quot;&gt;Solid...","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"032413c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It would be impossible to realise the gigantic size of the snow-flakes without seeing them. I can only compare them to a fall of oranges, though the diameter of an orange would be small in comparison with thousands of these snowflakes; in this immediate neighbourhood (i.e. within sight of the place of observation) at 50 yards off it produced a dense snow-wall. The wind was south, and almost calm, and the largest snow came down nearly perpendicularly. The temperature was 32\u00b0.6, and the air completely saturated with moisture. Before the storm the temperature was 34\u00b0.1. Snow had been falling with a slight thaw from 10 a.m., the snowflakes being small. Suddenly, at 12h. 12m. p.m. they became 2\u00bd inches in length;1 at 12h. 14m. they had increased to 2\u00be inches; and one flake that was caught measured 2\u00beinches by 2\u00bd inches, and was 3/10 of an inch thick. At 12h. 16m. the flakes had increased in size to 3\u00bd inches (and several measured were 4 inches across, and there were several larger ones not near enough to be caught); at 12h. 19m. they were somewhat less, and at 12h. 20m. though large, were not gigantic. Fortunately I was measuring and weighing snow at the time, with two assistants, and had a number of flat circular glasses kept cold ready for the purpose of catching crystals, and for measuring the snow that fell upon these glasses.

A dozen of these large flakes were caught, each on a separate piece of glass, measured and removed under cover, my two assistants giving valuable aid.

It occurs upon the monuments and utensils of every primitive people from China to Yucatan. In many, perhaps in a majority of, instances it is used as a symbol of the sun. One of the oldest and most widely occurring forms is the cross with crampons turned to the right or left, the svastika and sauvastika of India, the \u201cThor's hammer\u201d of Western Europe. Prof. Max M\u00fcller thinks that the svastika represents the vernal sun, and is hence an emblem of life, health, and creative energy (Schliemann's \u201cIlios,\u201d p. 348). Mr. Edward Thomas (ibid.) believes it to have arisen from the conception of the sun as a rolling wheel. The Chaldean sun symbol was first a circle, then a circle with an inscribed cross. The symbol of the sun-god at Sippara is a small circle with four triangular rays, the four angles between being occupied by radiating lines, and the whole circumscribed by a larger circle. The same symbol occurs repeatedly upon the shell gorgets of the mound-builders (Second Annual Report of the U. S. Bureau of Ethnology, plates liii., lviii., and lix.). The peculiar figure repeated upon the facade of the \u201cHouse of the Nuns\u201d at Uxmal seems to be a conventionalised circle and cross with rays. The Moqui symbol for the sun is a Greek cross with a small circle at the centre, in which are three marks to indicate the eyes and mouth of a face (First Annual Report of the U. S. Bureau of Ethnology, p. 371). It is needless to multiply examples: the important question is, How has the cross come to be a symbol of the sun? If anyone will observe carefully a lamp, or other bright light, with partially closed eyes, the answer will be obvious. The rays which appear to proceed from the luminous point always form a cross of some kind. A little experimenting will show that this appearance is due to reflection from the eyelashes and edges of the eyelids. The same experiment may be tried with the sun itself: if observed when considerably above the horizon, squinting will be unavoidable. If the head is erect, the downward arm of the cross will be much the strongest, and the upward arm may be obsolete; but if the head is thrown back, the arms will be nearly equal. The evolution of the sun symbol seems to have been as follows: He was first represented by a circle or disk as he appears when near the horizon; observations made when he was shining brightly revealed the crossed rays. This led to a combination of the circle and cross. If this hypothesis be correct, the svastika was originally neither a rolling wheel, nor, as Burnouf supposes, the crossed sticks from which our ancestors elicited fire; but it is a modification of the circle and inscribed cross.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"35","prism.number":"902","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"345","prism.endingPage":"346","prism.copyright":"1887 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/035345f0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/035345f0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/035345f0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/035345f0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Cross as a Sun Symbol","citation_volume":"35","citation_issue":"902","citation_publication_date":"1887/02","citation_firstpage":"345","citation_lastpage":"346","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/035345f0","DOI":"10.1038/035345f0","citation_doi":"10.1038/035345f0","description":"THE use of the cross as a sacred symbol dates from the earliest times, and is almost universal.

Now how can this be? If we regard it from a thermal point of view, we find that, in the combination of HCl with NH3, 41,900 units of heat are given out, while the combinations H with Cl and N with H3 give out 22,000 and 11,890 units respectively; that is, the residual affinity of N for Cl, as measured by heat, exceeds by about one-third the sum of the affinities of H for Cl and H3 for N; and yet, under ordinary circumstances, Cl has very little affinity for N. Is it not more rational to conclude that the residual affinity is not confined to the negative elements, but extends to both, and that the combination of HCl and NH3 is due mainly to the residual affinity of Cl and N for H? It is easy to understand that this residual affinity is so lowered in intensity that neither Cl nor N can retain unassisted more than one and three atoms; but when the energy of the H is reduced by combination with another body, each of them can then act upon it. That residual affinity exists in both positive and negative elements seems to roe evident from the fact that the heats of solution of salts in water vary directly as the affinity of the metal for the O of the water and also directly as the affinity of the negative element for the H, as I have pointed out in my letter on \u201cLaws of Solution,\u201d in NATURE, vol. xxxiv. p. 263.

Neither a source of light at 93,000,000 miles, nor one at 93 inches, could cast the bar-shadows. It is impossible to say whether they are meant to be a\u00ebrial in the dust or mist, or cast on the walls and wainscot. But for either they are equally preternatural, though not by diverging perspectively. If cast on the solids they would, instead of being straight, be crooking in and out over the mouldings. But if they are in a\u00ebrial mist or dust, the error is in supposing the same eye can see more than one of such shadows at a time.

Neither a source of light at 93,000,000 miles, nor one at 93 inches, could cast the bar-shadows. It is impossible to say whether they are meant to be a\u00ebrial in the dust or mist, or cast on the walls and wainscot. But for either they are equally preternatural, though not by diverging perspectively. If cast on the solids they would, instead of being straight, be crooking in and out over the mouldings. But if they are in a\u00ebrial mist or dust, the error is in supposing the same eye can see more than one of such shadows at a time. The eye requires to be very nearly in the plane of the shadow seen, so that, of those cast by parallel things, as window-bars, only one could be seen by any single eye, and only as continuing the line of the bar itself. The bar and its mist-shadow could never meet at an angle, as they all do in this picture.

Wharton. It is not because I wish to claim to have anticipitated the views which he gives as to the formation of atoll lagoons and barrier reef lagoons that I am writing to state that at the very date of the publication of Capt. Wharton's article I was engaged in writing a paper on coral formations, based upon a study of living corals at Diego Garcia, and on a consideration of the great submerged atolls known as the Great Chagos Bank and the Pitt and Centurion Banks, situated north and west of that island, in which I arrive at conclusions nearly identical with his. It has seemed to me, as it has to him, that the solution of dead coral rock in the interior of a reef does not sufficiently account for the formation of lagoons, and that the true cause of the atoll and barrier lagoons surrounded either by a reef which is awash, or by a strip of low land, lies in the peculiarly favourable conditions for coral growth present on the steep external slopes of the reef. In Diego Garcia I observed that although the shore reefs are for the most part covered with 1 or 2 feet of water, even at the lowest spring tides, yet their flat surfaces are nearly invariably barren of growing coral. Just at their edges, however, and on the steep external slopes beyond the edges, reef-building corals grow luxuriantly. According to Capt. Moresby, quoted by Mr. Darwin in his book on \u201cCoral Reefs,\u201d the flat surface of the rim of the Great Chagos Bank is barren of living corals, just as are the shore reefs of the neighbouring atoll of Diego Garcia; but the lagoon contains many knolls abundantly covered with living coral, and there is reason to think that living coral also occurs on the external slopes at Diego Garcia. Unlike Capt. Wharton, I do not consider the favourable conditions for coral growth on the external slopes to be connected with a better food supply, for this would be at variance with the existence of thriving coral patches within the lagoon, which, as I have seen at Diego Garcia, bear no relation to the lagoon mouths, through which food-bearing currents might be supposed to enter to the interior. Indeed, at the last-named atoll some of the most luxuriant coral patches are found at the south end of the lagoon, furthest away from the lagoon outlet. The favourable conditions are due, I believe, to the action of currents on coral growth. I noticed at Diego Garcia, and Dr. Hickson has made similar observations in the reefs near North Celebes, that corals do not thrive where they are subjected to the direct action of a strong current, nor do they grow in still water, where they are killed by the sand deposited upon them, but they flourish in places where a moderate current flows over them, not so strong as to dash them to pieces, but strong enough to prevent deposition of sand. Such conditions are found everywhere on the external slopes. At the side where a current impinges directly on a slope, the deeper parts of the current strike the slope first, and are in part thrown upwards over the sloping surface, thus moderating the direct force of the more superficial part of the same current. The main part of the current flows tangentially around the obstruction, and thus affords favourable conditions at the sides of the atoll or reef, and finally, on the side furthest from the current, the back-wash causes weak superficial currents which are also highly favourable to coral growth. Thus the coral grows to the greatest advantage around the periphery of a reef, and, as Capt. Wharton says, a ring-shaped reef is the result, and no theory of solution is required to explain the central depression.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"37","prism.number":"957","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"414","prism.endingPage":"415","prism.copyright":"1888 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/037414b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/037414b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/037414b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/037414b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"\u201cCoral Formations\u201d","citation_volume":"37","citation_issue":"957","citation_publication_date":"1888/03","citation_firstpage":"414","citation_lastpage":"415","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/037414b0","DOI":"10.1038/037414b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/037414b0","description":"I HAVE read with great interest the article on coral formations in your last number (p. 393), by Capt.

Like most, if not all, of the New Zealand glaciers of the first order, the lower mile or two is so thickly covered with rock debris that the ice can only be seen in the crevasses. All through the lower portion of the glacier the veined or ribboned structure is well marked, running nearly in the direction of the glacier. But at the terminal face there are two systems of veined structure, with the same strike but crossing one another at angles between 15\u00b0 and 20\u00b0.

Like most, if not all, of the New Zealand glaciers of the first order, the lower mile or two is so thickly covered with rock debris that the ice can only be seen in the crevasses. All through the lower portion of the glacier the veined or ribboned structure is well marked, running nearly in the direction of the glacier. But at the terminal face there are two systems of veined structure, with the same strike but crossing one another at angles between 15\u00b0 and 20\u00b0. In one system the blue bands are small, from a half to one inch thick, and separated from each other by bands of white ice, with large air-bubbles, about twice the thickness of the blue bands. The blue bands are irregular and sometimes anastomose. This system is similar to the veined structure found higher up the glacier.","dc.creator":["HUTTON, F.

Douglas Ogilby, of the Ichthyological Department of the Australian Museum at Sydney. This extraordinary fish belongs to the family of the red rock cods. Not many years ago these fishes (the red rock cod and its allies) formed a part of a most miscellaneous collection of species, which, under the general title of Triglid\u00e6, included the true gurnards (Trigla and Lepidotrigla), the flying gurnards (Dactylopterus), and the flat-heads (Platycephalus). In 1860, however, Dr. G\u00fcnther wisely separated these fishes from the Triglid\u00e6, which family he broke up into four distinct groups. The first of these, named by him Scorp\u00e6nid\u00e6, is that to which the specimen just captured at Sydney belongs. All the Scorp\u00e6nid\u00e6 are carnivorous marine fishes, most of which live at the bottom of the sea, and are generally provided with a powerful armature of the head and fin spines; while many possess skinny appendages on the head and body variously developed, which, owing to their resemblance to the fronds of seaweeds, serve the double purpose of enabling them the more easily to obtain their food, and the more effectually to conceal themselves from their enemies. As they are mostly of a small size, this latter point is evidently of no slight value, because, being slow, lazy fishes, they would, without some such means of protection, be unable to cope with their swifter antagonists. Nature has additionally protected this family by enabling it to vary its coloration according to any change of locality which it may be necessary to make, so as, chameleon-like, to fit itself for adaptation to the various phases of life under which it may be called on to exist. The genus Glyptauchen, of which the species just received by Mr. Ogilby is the sole representative, was separated in 1860 by Dr. A. G\u00fcnther from the Cuvierian genus Apistus, for the reception of a fish from King George's Sound, Western Australia, described many years ago by Sir John Richardson under the name of A. panduratus.

I beg to remark that in the year 1879 I recorded this species from Siao, and in the year 1884 from Great Sangi, on both of which islands, besides, occurs a Megapodius peculiar to them, viz. M. sanghirensis, Schlegel, representing there M. gilberti, Gray, from Celebes (see the Ibis, 1879, p. 139; Isis, 1884, pp. 6 and 53, &c.). Perhaps Mr. Guillemard did not comprise Siao and Great Sangi under the head of \u201csmaller islands,\u201d but Dr. Hickson himself (p. 95) records two brush-turkeys from the smaller island of Tagulandang, a larger and a smaller one, and these must be Megacephalon maleo and a Megapodius.

From the volcano islet of Ruang, opposite and within about a: mile from Tagulandang, he only records (p. 41) one brush-turkey, and this, of course, may be either the Megacephalon or a Megapoadius, if both do not occur, as appears rather probable.

I beg to remark that in the year 1879 I recorded this species from Siao, and in the year 1884 from Great Sangi, on both of which islands, besides, occurs a Megapodius peculiar to them, viz. M. sanghirensis, Schlegel, representing there M. gilberti, Gray, from Celebes (see the Ibis, 1879, p. 139; Isis, 1884, pp. 6 and 53, &c.). Perhaps Mr. Guillemard did not comprise Siao and Great Sangi under the head of \u201csmaller islands,\u201d but Dr. Hickson himself (p. 95) records two brush-turkeys from the smaller island of Tagulandang, a larger and a smaller one, and these must be Megacephalon maleo and a Megapodius. Tagulandang is situated between Celebes and Siao, and much nearer to the latter island. From the volcano islet of Ruang, opposite and within about a: mile from Tagulandang, he only records (p. 41) one brush-turkey, and this, of course, may be either the Megacephalon or a Megapoadius, if both do not occur, as appears rather probable.

Yet the flowers it frequents in the island are not red, but mostly white and yellow (see \u201cTropical Nature.\u201d p. 272).

G.M.T., I had the good fortune to witness the display of a most magnificent fire-ball meteor. It rose rapidly with a bright blue trail from an altitude of 6\u00b0 above the horizon, at a point 7\u00b0 south of west, and in about 7 seconds of time attained a culminating altitude of 55\u00b0 at a point 19\u00b0 north of west. Two large trees interlaced prevented me from seeing the head of the meteor till shortly before its culmination, but the light given out by it soon after its first appearance was equal to that of the full moon, and at culmination if much surpassed the light of a full moon in a cloudless sky. The ball seemed to be of a most dazzling bluish-grey colour, and it had a diameter of at least three-quarters of a degree. The disk presented a nebulous appearance with radiations within it as from a centre, but was well defined, except on its lower edge. The glare was almost too much for eyesight, and although the night was very frosty, calm, and clear, all the stars in the west became invisible. I turned to look again very shortly after, and at 5 seconds from culmination found the meteor had become a small yellow ball only one-twelfth of a degree in diameter, and was dropping ruddy sparks. It then disappeared at an altitude of 23\u00b0 towards a point about 51\u00b0 north of west. My impression was that this meteor was at no great distance from this place in any part of its course (lat. 51\u00b0 20 N., long, 3m. os. E.). I noted the positions relatively to trees and tall shrubs, and measured them exactly with a theodolite this morning. To-day I hear that the fire-ball was seen to fall by a man in Chestnut Street, a hamlet on the Maidstone road, and then appeared quite close to him. The direction of fall accords fairly well with my own observation, and would make it descend about two and one-third miles from me. At culmination I should say it seemed very much nearer to me, considering especially its great apparent size at that time. I heard not the slightest noise either of rushing or bursting.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"43","prism.number":"1103","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"150","prism.endingPage":"151","prism.copyright":"1890 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/043150c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/043150c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/043150c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/043150c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"A Large and Brilliant Fire-ball Meteor","citation_volume":"43","citation_issue":"1103","citation_publication_date":"1890/12","citation_firstpage":"150","citation_lastpage":"151","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/043150c0","DOI":"10.1038/043150c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/043150c0","description":"ON Sunday night, December 14, between 9h. 40m., and 9h. 45m.

The total length of these two glaciers is certainly something between sixty and seventy miles measured upon the map, and over this distance the glacial forces in action are on the grandest scale. The view obtained of the Hisper glacier from the two points we ascended on either side of the Nushik La is hardly to be described, from thence the end of the Hisper glacier is not defined, and could only be indicated from the run of the spurs on the north side of the valley, and what information the guides could give. This made the total length sixty-four miles. By traversing this length of the two glaciers Mr. Conway has been able to get into ground never before visited, viz., that great ice field on the main range of the Mustakh, the full extent of which is quite unknown, and from which the Nobundi Sobundi branch of the Panmah glaciers also descends. Most interesting will it be to read the account of this glacial area from the pen of a man who knows the Alps so well, and has ascended so many of its peaks. He has gone direct and fresh from the one to the other\u2014what an exquisite treat\u2014and he has now seen glacial action on the vastest scale it is presented at the present time in a mountain chain out of Polar latitudes. My experience was the reverse of this, for I had not the opportunity of seeing an Alpine glacier until twenty years after I had been surveying those on the Yarkund and Hunza frontiers, and in the interval the vividness of their aspects and minor details had much faded. It is to be hoped that Mr. Conway has with him, and used, a plane table, properly projected on the four miles to the inch scale, with all the peaks fixed by the Trigonometrical Survey of India, correctly plotted on it, and will thus be enabled to add to and correct much of the previous reconnaissance work. There is no doubt, had Capt. Younghusband, who was another late explorer in this part of the world, worked with a plane table along his line of route towards Hunza, the results of his exploration would have been of tenfold value, and far more extended. The Indian Government should make it a rule that all officers permitted or selected to explore the unsurveyed territory beyond our Indian frontier, should, as a preliminary training, do a season's work plane-tabling with a Himalayan survey party. It would also be an admirable training for officers selected for the Quartermaster-General's and Intelligence Departments.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"46","prism.number":"1194","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"464","prism.endingPage":"464","prism.copyright":"1892 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/046464b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/046464b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/046464b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/046464b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Mustakh Exploration","citation_volume":"46","citation_issue":"1194","citation_publication_date":"1892/09","citation_firstpage":"464","citation_lastpage":"464","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/046464b0","DOI":"10.1038/046464b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/046464b0","description":"MR.

My first impression was that they were either some fires on shore, apparently higher from the horizon than a ship's masthead, or some junk's \u201cflare up\u201d lights raised by mirage. To the naked eye they appeared sometimes as a mass; at others, spread out in an irregular line, and, being globular in form, they resembled Chinese lanterns festooned between the masts of a lofty vessel. They bore north (magnetic), and remained on that bearing until lost sight of about midnight. As the ship was passing the land to the eastward at the rate of seven knots an hour, it soon became obvious that the lights were not on the land, though observed with the mountain behind them.","dc.creator":["NORCOCK, CHAS.

The following considerations show that it is possible under certain suppositions to have a number of spectral rays with a very restricted number of degrees of freedom. Most of us, I believe, now accept a definite atomic charge of electricity, and if each charge is imagined to be capable of moving along the surface of an atom, it would represent two degrees of freedom. If a molecule is capable of sending out a homogeneous vibration, it means that there must be a definite position of equilibrium of the \u201celectron.\u201d If there are several such positions, the vibrations may take place in several periods. Any one molecule may perform for a certain time a simple periodic oscillation about one position of equilibrium, and owing to some impact the electron may be knocked over into a new position. The vibrations under these circumstances would not be quite homogeneous, but if the electron oscillates about any one position sufficiently long to perform a few thousand oscillations, we should hardly notice the want of homogeneity. Each electron at a given time would only send out vibrations which in our instruments would appear as homogeneous. Each molecule could thus successively give rise to a number of spectral rays, and at any one time the electron in the different molecules would, by the laws of probability, be distributed over all possible positions of equilibrium, so that we should always see all the vibrations which any one molecule of the gas is capable of sending out. The probability of an electron oscillating about one of its positions of equilibrium need not be the same in all cases. Hence a line may be weak not because the vibration has a smaller amplitude, but because fewer molecules give rise to it. The fact that the vibrations of a gas are not quite homogeneous, is borne out by experiment. If impacts become more frequent by increased pressure, we should expect from the above views that the time during which an electron performs a certain oscillation is shortened; hence the line should widen, which is the case. I have spoken, for the sake of simplicity, as if an electron vibrating about one position of equilibrium could only do so in one period. If the forces called into play, by a displacement, depend on the direction of the displacement, there would be two possible frequencies. If the surface is nearly symmetrical, we should have double lines.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"51","prism.number":"1317","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"293","prism.endingPage":"293","prism.copyright":"1895 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/051293a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/051293a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/051293a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/051293a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Kinetic Theory of Gases","citation_volume":"51","citation_issue":"1317","citation_publication_date":"1895/01","citation_firstpage":"293","citation_lastpage":"293","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/051293a0","DOI":"10.1038/051293a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/051293a0","description":"THE difficulty of reconciling line spectra with the kinetic theory of gases, has been referred to by Prof. Fitzgerald (NATURE, January 3, p. 221).

The various Mutillid\u00e6 are parasitic in the nests of these bees, and consequently do not live under identical conditions; we have a varied flora with its varied insect-visitors, and these with varied parasites, the whole series of phenomena intimately connected, though at first sight it would seem impossible to see any connection between the flowers and the mutillids, however indirect.","dc.creator":["COCKERELL, T.

The same method is given in detail in \u2018Wu-pei-chi\u2019 [by Mau Yuen-i, completed 1621], which is to be consulted for its particulars.\u201d Unfortunately all four copies in the British Museum of the Chinese work, here referred to, are wanting vol. clxxxvi., wherein further details of the method are said to be found.","dc.creator":["MINAKATA, KUMAGUSU"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["MINAKATA, KUMAGUSU"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"On Augury from Combat of Shell-fish","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;On Augury from Combat of Shell-fish&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"056391b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

As to the energy available, at p. 14 of my book on \u201cSteam\u201d I say:\u2014\u201cOn one square foot of Egypt the heat energy received in one year from the sun is about 109 foot pounds, or 500 horse-power hours.\u201d This is nearly equivalent to the energy of a coating of coal all over Egypt one foot thick, and promises a future for the Sahara and other cloudless regions of the earth. I therefore admit that I did not give sufficient weight to this consideration of the direct heat from the sun, and I am very glad that Mr. Rosenhain has drawn attention to my neglect.","dc.creator":["PERRY, J."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["PERRY, J."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Misuse of Coal","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Misuse of Coal&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"066620a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

SULLY has given us in his latest work a model monograph on laughter.1 With much charm and penetration, and in the light of a wide knowledge of the very extensive literature of the subject, he discusses the nature, causes and effects of laughter, its uses, its origin, its development and its future in the race and in the individual. He criticises the more important of the many theories of the ludicrous propounded by philosophers in all ages; he shows that each one of them fails to account for a considerable proportion of the many varieties of the ludicrous, and he concludes \u201cthat the impressions of the laughable cannot be reduced to one or two principles.\u201d While thus recognising the impossibility of bringing all kinds of laughter-causing things under one-formula, Prof. Sully points to two causes of laughter which are closely allied and frequently cooperate, namely a sudden oncoming of gladness and a sudden release from constraint, and these, he regards as the two principles most generally applicable to the explanation of the nature of the ludicrous. There is implied here and throughout the book me assumption that \u201cthe laugh is in general an expression of a pleasurable state of feeling,\u201d an assumption which finds also explicit expression in several passages, e.g. \u201cthat outburst of gladness which we call laughter\u201d and \u201claughter being primarily the expression of the fuller measure of the happy or gladsome state.\u201d It is assumed, in fact, that that which makes us laugh does so in general in virtue of its pleasing us, or, more shortly, that in general we laugh because we are pleased.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"67","prism.number":"1736","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"318","prism.endingPage":"319","prism.copyright":"1903 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/067318a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/067318a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/067318a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/067318a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Theory of Laughter","citation_volume":"67","citation_issue":"1736","citation_publication_date":"1903/02","citation_firstpage":"318","citation_lastpage":"319","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/067318a0","DOI":"10.1038/067318a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/067318a0","description":"PROF.

I found that one of my pupils, Mr. Glasgow, was assuming that the expansion and compression parts of a gas engine diagram followed laws of the type pvn constant; in cases where there was a probability that the clearance had not been measured accurately, so that v being the measured volume and c the constant error, he assumed p(v+e)n to be constaznt, and he was enabled to find c from the curve. There is no reason to believe that these curves ought to have such a law, although, curiously enough, following this assumption, the clearance obtained from the compression curve is usually not very different from that obtained from the expansion curve. Mr. Glasgow's method of finding c is much the same as what I shall now describe. An empirical formula of the type y=a+bxn would be exceedingly useful in many parts of pure and applied science if, when given a table of values of y and x, we could readily find a, b and n. I have often sought for a method of working, but without success. If a is zero, we have only to plot log y and log x as the coordinates of points on squared paper. If a is not zero, there is a clumsy method of using logarithmic paper which may be adopted, but it is not satisfactory. We now have a method easy of application.

While working in company with a colleague on Divis Mountain, Belfast, in 1902, our attention was attracted by the peculiar formation of ice so admirably described by your correspondent of March 15. It seemed perfectly obvious that the ice-pillars had, in growing, lifted the earth and stones by exerting a pushing force in the direction of their length, and that without lateral support, putting the expansive force of water on freezing out of the question as an explanation.

While working in company with a colleague on Divis Mountain, Belfast, in 1902, our attention was attracted by the peculiar formation of ice so admirably described by your correspondent of March 15. It seemed perfectly obvious that the ice-pillars had, in growing, lifted the earth and stones by exerting a pushing force in the direction of their length, and that without lateral support, putting the expansive force of water on freezing out of the question as an explanation. All doubt on this point was removed by our finding an impression of a nailed boot, made in the mud before the frost, and on which the pillars had grown on all parts of the mud on which there were no impressions of nails, and were wanting wherever the nails had been.

JOLY'S interesting discovery (NATURE, May 2, p. 8) that typical rocks in the Simplon Tunnel contain quantities of radium considerably in excess of the average of igneous rocks raises a question. From Mr. Strutt's investigations it appears that the average content of igneous rocks would be sufficient to account for the ordinary temperature gradient in the earth's crust were it due to radium. It seems, therefore, that, if the temperature was so caused, the gradient in the Simplon Tunnel ought to have been higher than the average, viz. 1\u00b0 F. for between 50 feet and 60 feet. But, in fact, as beneath other mountains, it was considerably lower. In NATURE, October 27, 1904, it is stated that the temperature of the rocks in the advanced gallery was 108\u00b0 F. where the cover was 7005 feet. This gives 1\u00b0 F. for 92 feet.

JOLY'S interesting discovery (NATURE, May 2, p. 8) that typical rocks in the Simplon Tunnel contain quantities of radium considerably in excess of the average of igneous rocks raises a question. From Mr. Strutt's investigations it appears that the average content of igneous rocks would be sufficient to account for the ordinary temperature gradient in the earth's crust were it due to radium. It seems, therefore, that, if the temperature was so caused, the gradient in the Simplon Tunnel ought to have been higher than the average, viz. 1\u00b0 F. for between 50 feet and 60 feet. But, in fact, as beneath other mountains, it was considerably lower. In NATURE, October 27, 1904, it is stated that the temperature of the rocks in the advanced gallery was 108\u00b0 F. where the cover was 7005 feet. This gives 1\u00b0 F. for 92 feet. In the St. Gothard Tunnel it was 1\u00b0 F. for 102 feet, and in the Mt. Cenis Tunnel 1\u00b0 F. for 100 feet. That the gradient in the Simplon Tunnel, though low, was somewhat higher than in the other two was probably caused by the spring 23\u00b0 hotter than the rock, which brought up heat from a lower level. I think I have shown in my \u201cPhysics of the Earth's Crust,\u201d chapter xvi., that these low gradients-can but very slightly be attributed to the convexity of the surface.","dc.creator":["FISHER, O."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["FISHER, O."],"citation_author_institution":["Graveley, Huntingdon"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Radium and Geology","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Radium and Geology&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"076222b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Subcutaneous adipose tissue represents an accessible reservoir for the isolation of human stromal cells. Ex vivo, the adipose tissue-derived human stromal cells can be expanded more than 100-fold. These primary cultures respond to adipogenic agonists by accumulating lipid and expressing adipocyte specific proteins, including leptin and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3).

Subcutaneous adipose tissue represents an accessible reservoir for the isolation of human stromal cells. Ex vivo, the adipose tissue-derived human stromal cells can be expanded more than 100-fold. These primary cultures respond to adipogenic agonists by accumulating lipid and expressing adipocyte specific proteins, including leptin and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3). In contrast, when the adipose tissue-derived stromal cells are exposed to osteogenic factors, they display osteoblastic gene markers and mineralize their extracellular matrix.

The emission theory which he supports, and which he claims to have originated, regards kathode rays from the sun as the electric carriers, and so is presumably the same as has been actively advocated by Prof. Kr. Birkeland for a number of years. He seems, however, to be unaware of the existence of Birkeland's volumes1 on the subject, and of the numerous numerical calculations therein contained. He also makes no reference to the important mathematical work of Prof. St\u00f6rmer, which cannot, I think, be disregarded by anyone whose theory postulates the introduction of charged particles from without into the earth's magnetic field. The general idea that magnetic storms are due to some action arising in the sun goes back to at least the time of Broun and Balfour Stewart, and different forms of the emission theory have naturally presented themselves to various minds independently, as R\u00f6ntgen, kathode, and other rays came successively under our ken. It is when we come to details that real troubles arise. Most people, I take it, have little difficulty in believing in a general way that the changes of declination experienced at a single magnetic observatory, say Kew, during a magnetic storm can be accounted for by a stream of electrons in the magnetic meridian, provided it is possible for the direction and intensity of the stream to be altered at frequent intervals. One doubts this just as little as that the motion of the magnet of the declination magnetograph at Kew on September 25 could be reproduced with the aid of a copper wire, a single battery cell, a commutator, and a resistance box. Those who have seen St\u00f6rmer's calculations and studied Birkeland's volumes will realise, however, that to be regarded as an advance of knowledge at the present day, a theory must afford an explanation, not merely of what is taking place in a single magnetic element at a single station, but of what is taking place in all three elements at a number of stations. Coming, now, to Sir Oliver Lodge's own calculation, it seems based on an inadequate idea of the phenomena of the late storm, derived from a description of one or two of the more striking changes at Kew as recorded in your columns and those of the Times. It is rare for a disturbance to be limited to the declination, i.e. for the disturbing force to be wholly perpendicular to the magnetic meridian. The component in the magnetic meridian is, as a matter of fact, usually the larger. A vertical component is also usually present. A magnetic storm does not usually consist of a disturbing force in a fixed or nearly fixed direction, waxing and waning. Each of the three elements usually exhibits values both above and below the normal, and not infrequently there are many excursions on both sides of the mean. This will, I think, be readily recognised by anyone who consults the reproduction of the Stonyhurst curve of September 25 in your columns and of the Kew curves in the Electrician. After inspecting these curves it will, I think, be recognised that it is quite out of the question to limit the passage of the imaginary solar jet, as Sir Oliver Lodge does, to the fifteen minutes near the end of the storm, when there occurred the prominent declination oscillation to which he has confined his attention. Even whilst this oscillation took place, it was far from representing the total disturbance. Simultaneously with it, but partly overlapping, as is often the case, there was a very large change in progress in the horizontal force. Those looking at the curves will, I think, agree that if there was a jet such as Sir Oliver Lodge supposes, its time of transit took, not fifteen minutes, but at least nine hours. His estimate of the diameter of the cone thus requires multiplication by 36, with a consequent multiplication of the cross-section, if it were circular, by 1296. Large as this may appear, the jet theory requires it to be often exceeded, as the storm of September 25 was an unusually short one. The average duration of the storms in Mr. Maunder's Greenwich list, from 1882 to 1903, was almost exactly thirty hours, so that the cross-section of the average storm-jet would be naturally fully 14,000 times that given by the calculation in your columns. The really crucial thing is that the magnetic disturbances which occur simultaneously at different stations are inter-related. It is in accounting satisfactorily for these inter-relations that Birkeland, who has given years of thought to the subject, encounters his main difficulties.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"81","prism.number":"2085","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"456","prism.endingPage":"456","prism.copyright":"1909 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/081456b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/081456b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/081456b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/081456b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Magnetic Storms and Solar Eruptions","citation_volume":"81","citation_issue":"2085","citation_publication_date":"1909/10","citation_firstpage":"456","citation_lastpage":"456","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/081456b0","DOI":"10.1038/081456b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/081456b0","description":"I HAVE read Sir Oliver Lodge's letter (NATURE, October 7, p. 425) on the above subject with some surprise.

LEWIS BONHOTE has confirmed Mr. R. Staples Browne's statement that the web-foot in pigeons is a simple Mendelian recessive, but he finds that when webbed birds from two different strains are crossed an irregular result is obtained, viz. four normal and one webbed. Moreover, mating the first crosses yielded results in almost every case contrary to Mendelian expectations, normals throwing webs and webs throwing normals (NATURE, December 1, p. 160).

LEWIS BONHOTE has confirmed Mr. R. Staples Browne's statement that the web-foot in pigeons is a simple Mendelian recessive, but he finds that when webbed birds from two different strains are crossed an irregular result is obtained, viz. four normal and one webbed. Moreover, mating the first crosses yielded results in almost every case contrary to Mendelian expectations, normals throwing webs and webs throwing normals (NATURE, December 1, p. 160). Similar results have been obtained with West Highland terriers, in which white is apparently recessive to yellow. The offspring of pure-bred white terriers belonging to the same strain are white, but the offspring of pure-bred white terriers from different strains are sometimes yellow.

Such an arrangement appears to a photographer fatal to the formation of an image sharp in line and dot.","dc.creator":["HILL, ALEX"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["HILL, ALEX"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Are Eyes ever Autophanous?","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Are Eyes ever Autophanous?&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"088484d0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It may be described as follows: every evening after sunset when twilight has completely died out of the western sky there is observable an illumination, starting due west and extending upwards to a height of about 40\u00b0 above the horizon, fading away towards the top; in character it is much like the Milky Way, a little broader at its base, slightly less brilliant but more uniform. It extended this evening (August 10) from a point due west at 7.30 p.m., Gallegos mean solar time, upwards to a height of about 35\u00b0 from the horizon, in the direction of the planet Jupiter, inclining towards the north at an angle with the horizon of about 60\u00b0.

It may be described as follows: every evening after sunset when twilight has completely died out of the western sky there is observable an illumination, starting due west and extending upwards to a height of about 40\u00b0 above the horizon, fading away towards the top; in character it is much like the Milky Way, a little broader at its base, slightly less brilliant but more uniform. It extended this evening (August 10) from a point due west at 7.30 p.m., Gallegos mean solar time, upwards to a height of about 35\u00b0 from the horizon, in the direction of the planet Jupiter, inclining towards the north at an angle with the horizon of about 60\u00b0.

These series were observed a few years ago by Prof. Fowler by sending a heavy discharge through a mixture of hydrogen and helium; previously they had been observed only in star spectra. In addition, Evans observed that under the same conditions as the 4686 series and the Pickering series a new series of lines appeared, which, with regard to position and intensity, could be united with the Pickering series into a single series of the same type as the 4686 series. The lines of the new series have wave-lengths very close to the hydrogen lines of the Balmer series. In his letter Prof. Nicholson expresses the opinion that Evans's results cannot be used to discriminate between the different theoretical interpretations of the spectra in question, since the new series as well as the Pickering series can be deduced from the 4686 series on the general principle of combination of spectral lines. I cannot agree with this view, and should like here to state my reasons.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"95","prism.number":"2366","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"6","prism.endingPage":"7","prism.copyright":"1915 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/095006a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/095006a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/095006a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/095006a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Spectra of Hydrogen and Helium","citation_volume":"95","citation_issue":"2366","citation_publication_date":"1915/03","citation_firstpage":"6","citation_lastpage":"7","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/095006a0","DOI":"10.1038/095006a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/095006a0","description":"IN a letter to NATURE of February 11, Prof. J.

T. Gunther describes a very beautiful freezing effect. I recently obtained a similar effect on a much larger scale. One of the large bottles, holding several litres, used for collecting rainfall in the London parks, in connection with the investigation of atmospheric pollution, was found, when brought into the laboratory for examination, to contain a hollow cylinder or annulus of ice, perforated with silvery air-tubes arranged, as Dr. Gunther remarks, for all the world like lines of force round a magnetic pole.

T. Gunther describes a very beautiful freezing effect. I recently obtained a similar effect on a much larger scale. One of the large bottles, holding several litres, used for collecting rainfall in the London parks, in connection with the investigation of atmospheric pollution, was found, when brought into the laboratory for examination, to contain a hollow cylinder or annulus of ice, perforated with silvery air-tubes arranged, as Dr. Gunther remarks, for all the world like lines of force round a magnetic pole.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the neurotrophins that is widely expressed in the hippocampal formation and has been implicated in the neurobiology of schizophrenia. Polymorphisms in the BDNF gene may therefore confer risk for schizophrenia through hippocampal pathogenesis and/or making the hippocampus more susceptible to environmental insults. In this study, we investigated whether val66met, a functional and abundant missense polymorphism in the coding region of the BDNF gene, was associated with the volume of the hippocampal formation in 19 patients with first-episode schizophrenia and 25 healthy volunteers. A total of 124 contiguous T1-weighted coronal MR images (slice thickness=1.5\u2009mm) were acquired through the whole head using a 3D Fast SPGR IR Prep sequence on a 1.5\u2009T GE imaging system. Volumes of the right and left hippocampal formation were measured manually by an operator blind to group status and genotype. All participants were genotyped for the BDNF val66met locus. Mixed model analyses revealed a main effect of BDNF val66met genotype such that in the combined sample of patients and healthy volunteers, val/val homozygotes (N=27) had larger volumes of the hippocampal formation compared to val/met heterozygotes (N=17). In separate analyses by group, however, val66met genotype accounted for a greater proportion of the variance in the volume of the hippocampal formation in patients compared to healthy volunteers.

Covariance between relatives may be due not only to genes, but also to shared environments, and most previous models have assumed different degrees of similarity induced by environments specific to twins, to non-twin siblings (henceforth siblings), and to parents and offspring. We now evaluate an alternative model that replaces these three environments by two maternal womb environments, one for twins and another for siblings, along with a common home environment. Meta-analysis of 212 previous studies shows that our \u2018maternal-effects\u2019 model fits the data better than the \u2018family-environments\u2019 model. Maternal effects, often assumed to be negligible, account for 20% of covariance between twins and 5% between siblings, and the effects of genes are correspondingly reduced, with two measures of heritability being less than 50%. The shared maternal environment may explain the striking correlation between the IQs of twins, especially those of adult twins that were reared apart. IQ heritability increases during early childhood, but whether it stabilizes thereafter remains unclear. A recent study of octogenarians2, for instance, suggests that IQ heritability either remains constant through adolescence and adulthood3, or continues to increase with age2. Although the latter hypothesis has recently been endorsed4, it gathers only modest statistical support in our analysis when compared to the maternal-effects hypothesis. Our analysis suggests that it will be important to understand the basis for these maternal effects if ways in which IQ might be increased are to be identified.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"388","prism.number":"6641","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"468","prism.endingPage":"471","prism.copyright":"1997 Macmillan Magazines Ltd.","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/41319","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/41319","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/41319.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/41319","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The heritability of IQ","citation_volume":"388","citation_issue":"6641","citation_publication_date":"1997/07","citation_firstpage":"468","citation_lastpage":"471","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/41319","DOI":"10.1038/41319","citation_doi":"10.1038/41319","description":"IQ heritability, the portion of a population's IQ variability attributable to the effects of genes1, has been investigated for nearly a century, yet it remains controversial.

Meta-analysis of 212 previous studies shows that our \u2018maternal-effects\u2019 model fits the data better than the \u2018family-environments\u2019 model. Maternal effects, often assumed to be negligible, account for 20% of covariance between twins and 5% between siblings, and the effects of genes are correspondingly reduced, with two measures of heritability being less than 50%. The shared maternal environment may explain the striking correlation between the IQs of twins, especially those of adult twins that were reared apart. IQ heritability increases during early childhood, but whether it stabilizes thereafter remains unclear. A recent study of octogenarians2, for instance, suggests that IQ heritability either remains constant through adolescence and adulthood3, or continues to increase with age2. Although the latter hypothesis has recently been endorsed4, it gathers only modest statistical support in our analysis when compared to the maternal-effects hypothesis. Our analysis suggests that it will be important to understand the basis for these maternal effects if ways in which IQ might be increased are to be identified.","dc.creator":["Devlin, B.","Daniels, Michael","Roeder, Kathryn"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_title=Introduction to Quantitative Genetics; citation_publication_date=1981; citation_id=CR1; citation_author=DS Falconer","citation_journal_title=Science; citation_title=Substantial genetic influence on cognitive abilities in twins 80 or more years old.; citation_author=GE McClearn; citation_volume=276; citation_publication_date=1997; citation_pages=1560-1563; citation_doi=10.1126/science.276.5318.1560; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Science; citation_title=Twins: en route to QTLs for cognition.; citation_author=II Gottesman; citation_volume=276; citation_publication_date=1997; citation_pages=2522-1523; citation_doi=10.1126/science.276.5318.1522; citation_id=CR3","Task Force for Scientific Affairs.

This nanothermometer should be suitable for use in a wide variety of microenvironments.","dc.creator":["Gao, Yihua","Bando, Yoshio"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_author=SJ Tans, ARM Verschueren, C Dekker; citation_volume=393; citation_publication_date=1998; citation_pages=49-52; citation_doi=10.1038/29954; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_author=HJ Dai, JH Hafner, AG Rinzler, DT Colbert, RE Smalley; citation_volume=384; citation_publication_date=1996; citation_pages=147-150; citation_doi=10.1038/384147a0; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Science; citation_author=ZK Tang; citation_volume=292; citation_publication_date=2001; citation_pages=2462-2465; citation_doi=10.1126/science.1060470; citation_id=CR3","citation_journal_title=Science; citation_author=P Poncharal, ZL Wang, D Ugarte, WA de Heer; citation_volume=283; citation_publication_date=1999; citation_pages=1513-1516; citation_doi=10.1126/science.283.5407.1513; citation_id=CR4","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_author=MMJ Treacy, TW Ebbesen, JM Gibson; citation_volume=381; citation_publication_date=1996; citation_pages=678-680; citation_doi=10.1038/381678a0; citation_id=CR5","citation_journal_title=Science; citation_author=P Kim, CM Lieber; citation_volume=286; citation_publication_date=1999; citation_pages=2148-2150; citation_doi=10.1126/science.286.5447.2148; citation_id=CR6","citation_journal_title=Science; citation_author=J Kong; citation_volume=287; citation_publication_date=2000; citation_pages=622-625; citation_doi=10.1126/science.287.5453.622; citation_id=CR7","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_author=AC Dillon; citation_volume=386; citation_publication_date=1997; citation_pages=377-379; citation_doi=10.1038/386377a0; citation_id=CR8","Lide, D.

Feather-pecking in domestic birds is associated with cannibalism and severe welfare problems1.

However, isolating human blood polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) for genomic analysis has been challenging. We used a novel microfluidic technique that isolates PMNs by capturing CD66b+ cells and compared it with dextran-Ficoll gradient isolation. We also used microfluidic isolation techniques for blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to evaluate PMN genomic alterations secondary to pulmonary sequestration. PMNs obtained from ex vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated or -unstimulated whole blood from five healthy volunteers were isolated by either dextran-Ficoll gradient, microfluidics capture, or a combination of the two techniques. Blood and BAL fluid PMNs were also isolated using microfluidics from seven hospitalized patients with ARDS. Gene expression was inferred from extracted RNA using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips. All methods of PMN isolation produced similar quantities of high-quality RNA, when adjusted for recovered cell number. Unsupervised analysis and hierarchical clustering indicated that LPS stimulation was the primary factor affecting gene expression patterns among all ex vivo samples. Patterns of gene expression from blood and BAL PMNs differed significantly from each other in the patients with ARDS. Isolation of PMNs by microfluidics can be applied to both blood and BAL specimens from critically ill, hospitalized patients. Unique genomic expression patterns are obtained from the blood and BAL fluid of critically ill patients with ARDS, and these differ significantly from genomic patterns seen after ex vivo LPS stimulation.","prism.publicationName":"Laboratory Investigation","prism.publicationDate":"2011-09-19","prism.volume":"91","prism.number":"12","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"1787","prism.endingPage":"1795","prism.copyright":"2011 United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc.","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/labinvest201194","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/labinvest.2011.94","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/labinvest201194.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/labinvest201194","citation_journal_title":"Laboratory Investigation","citation_journal_abbrev":"Lab Invest","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1530-0307","citation_title":"Microfluidics-based capture of human neutrophils for expression analysis in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage","citation_volume":"91","citation_issue":"12","citation_publication_date":"2011/12","citation_online_date":"2011/09/19","citation_firstpage":"1787","citation_lastpage":"1795","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/labinvest.2011.94","DOI":"10.1038/labinvest.2011.94","citation_doi":"10.1038/labinvest.2011.94","description":"Gene expression analysis can be a powerful tool in predicting patient outcomes and identifying patients who may benefit from targeted therapies.

We have previously demonstrated that NE cells promote metastasis of a human prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) with overexpression of the gelsolin gene. The purpose of this study was to investigate the interactions between NE cells and LNCaP cells and the involvement of gelsolin in contributing to the invasive potential of LNCaP cells. In addition, we examined whether neurotensin induced gelsolin-mediated invasion. We used the NE cell line NE-CS that was established from the prostate of the LPB-Tag 12T-10 transgenic mouse. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting gelsolin or not targeting it was transfected into LNCaP cells. Cell invasion was assessed by Matrigel invasion assay. The supernatant of NE-CS cells and neurotensin induced the transformation of LNCaP cells. Neurotensin was observed in the supernatant of NE-CS cells but not in LNCaP cells. The siRNA targeting of gelsolin resulted in inhibition of invasion of LNCaP cells in the culture medium with neurotensin added, and in the supernatant of NE-CS cells with epidermal growth factor. The invasive potential of LNCaP cells enhanced by neurotensin or the supernatant of NE-CS cells through neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) was blocked by a phospholipase C\u03b3 inhibitor and an intracellular calcium chelator, with concomitant gelsolin suppression. This study indicates that NE cells and neurotensin induce gelsolin-mediated invasion of LNCaP cells through NTSR1 activation.","prism.publicationName":"Laboratory Investigation","prism.publicationDate":"2015-01-12","prism.volume":"95","prism.number":"3","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"283","prism.endingPage":"295","prism.copyright":"2015 United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/labinvest2014165","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/labinvest.2014.165","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/labinvest2014165.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/labinvest2014165","citation_journal_title":"Laboratory Investigation","citation_journal_abbrev":"Lab Invest","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1530-0307","citation_title":"The potential of neurotensin secreted from neuroendocrine tumor cells to promote gelsolin-mediated invasiveness of prostate adenocarcinoma cells","citation_volume":"95","citation_issue":"3","citation_publication_date":"2015/03","citation_online_date":"2015/01/12","citation_firstpage":"283","citation_lastpage":"295","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/labinvest.2014.165","DOI":"10.1038/labinvest.2014.165","citation_doi":"10.1038/labinvest.2014.165","description":"Neuroendocrine (NE) cells in prostate cancer have been shown to be associated with the progression of prostate cancer.

However, current lensless imaging methods are typically limited by the need for a light source with a narrow, stable and accurately known spectrum. We have developed a general approach to lensless imaging without spectral bandwidth limitations or sample requirements. We use two time-delayed coherent light pulses and show that scanning the pulse-to-pulse time delay allows the reconstruction of diffraction-limited images for all the spectral components in the pulse. In addition, we introduce an iterative phase retrieval algorithm that uses these spectrally resolved Fresnel diffraction patterns to obtain high-resolution images of complex extended objects. We demonstrate this two-pulse imaging method with octave-spanning visible light sources, in both transmission and reflection geometries, and with broadband extreme-ultraviolet radiation from a high-harmonic generation source. Our approach enables effective use of low-flux ultra-broadband sources, such as table-top high-harmonic generation systems, for high-resolution imaging.

Stefan Witte and co-workers from LaserLAB Amsterdam have developed a lensless scheme that employs two coherent time-delayed pulses and is compatible with broadband sources. Lensless imaging \u2014 whereby diffraction patterns are interpreted to reconstruct an image of a sample \u2014 is popular in the X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet regimes, where high-quality lenses for performing conventional imaging are not available. Because this approach has traditionally been limited to narrowband coherent radiation, scientists have been eager to make it compatible with broadband sources such as tabletop high-harmonic generation.

These emerging nanophotonic devices and materials have enabled researchers to develop disruptive methods of tremendously increasing the storage capacity of current optical memory. In this paper, we present a review of the recent advancements in nanophotonics-enabled optical storage techniques. Particularly, we offer our perspective of using them as optical storage arrays for next-generation exabyte data centers. The science and technology of nanophotonics can help dramatically increase the capacity of optical discs. After reviewing research into next-generation optical data storage, Min Gu, Xiangping Li and Yaoyu Cao from the Swinburne University of Technology in Australia have offered their perspective of the creation of exabyte-scale optical data centers.

These emerging nanophotonic devices and materials have enabled researchers to develop disruptive methods of tremendously increasing the storage capacity of current optical memory. In this paper, we present a review of the recent advancements in nanophotonics-enabled optical storage techniques. Particularly, we offer our perspective of using them as optical storage arrays for next-generation exabyte data centers. The science and technology of nanophotonics can help dramatically increase the capacity of optical discs. After reviewing research into next-generation optical data storage, Min Gu, Xiangping Li and Yaoyu Cao from the Swinburne University of Technology in Australia have offered their perspective of the creation of exabyte-scale optical data centers. They report that developments in \u2019super-resolution recording\u201a, which allow a light-sensitive material to be exposed to a focal spot that is smaller than the diffraction limit of light, will allow the size of recorded bits to shrink to just a few nanometres in size.

In fact, particles in air with a diameter of \u22642.5\u2009\u03bcm have been classified as carcinogenic by the World Health Organization. Here we present a field-portable cost-effective platform for high-throughput quantification of particulate matter using computational lens-free microscopy and machine-learning. This platform, termed c-Air, is also integrated with a smartphone application for device control and display of results. This mobile device rapidly screens 6.5\u2009L of air in 30\u2009s and generates microscopic images of the aerosols in air. It provides statistics of the particle size and density distribution with a sizing accuracy of ~93%. We tested this mobile platform by measuring the air quality at different indoor and outdoor environments and measurement times, and compared our results to those of an Environmental Protection Agency\u2013approved device based on beta-attenuation monitoring, which showed strong correlation to c-Air measurements. Furthermore, we used c-Air to map the air quality around Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) over 24\u2009h to confirm that the impact of LAX on increased PM concentration was present even at >7\u2009km away from the airport, especially along the direction of landing flights. With its machine-learning-based computational microscopy interface, c-Air can be adaptively tailored to detect specific particles in air, for example, various types of pollen and mold and provide a cost-effective mobile solution for highly accurate and distributed sensing of air quality. Accurate on-site air-quality monitoring can be performed using lens-free microscopy on a chip coupled with machine learning. To monitor and enhance air quality, it is vital to realize rapid, accurate and high-throughput sizing of airborne particles. A portable system built by Aydogan Ozcan and co-workers from the University of California, Los Angeles, generates statistics of particle size and density from microscopic images of particulate matter in air. A sticky coverslip captures airborne particles and then light from three LEDs (red, green and blue) creates holograms of the particle distribution, captured on a CMOS image sensor and processed. The system can screen 6.5 litres of air in about 30 s and has a particle sizing accuracy of about 93%. Results obtained using this technology achieved a strong correlation with those acquired using conventional particle-sizing devices.","prism.publicationName":"Light: Science & Applications","prism.publicationDate":"2017-03-15","prism.volume":"6","prism.number":"9","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"e17046","prism.endingPage":"e17046","prism.copyright":"2017 The Author(s)","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201746","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2017.46","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201746.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201746","citation_journal_title":"Light: Science & Applications","citation_journal_abbrev":"Light Sci Appl","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"2047-7538","citation_title":"Air quality monitoring using mobile microscopy and machine learning","citation_volume":"6","citation_issue":"9","citation_publication_date":"2017/09","citation_online_date":"2017/03/15","citation_firstpage":"e17046","citation_lastpage":"e17046","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2017.46","DOI":"10.1038/lsa.2017.46","citation_doi":"10.1038/lsa.2017.46","description":"Rapid, accurate and high-throughput sizing and quantification of particulate matter (PM) in air is crucial for monitoring and improving air quality.
