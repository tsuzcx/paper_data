From over 120 meteors mapped down (out of about 330 seen) it is evident that the principal radiant point, or rather line, is a line drawn from \u03b1 Persei to \u03b3 Persei, and onwards towards \u03b7. One bright meteor was seen on the 8th, just below \u03b7 Persei, which did not move more than 1/6\u00b0 in a second of time, and left a cloud behind it lasting about two seconds. A remarkable feature was the outlying radiants, as they appeared to be, one of which was situated at or near \u03b8 Cassiopei\u00e6, another near the star c of Camelopardalis. The radiant situated between \u03b4 Cygni and \u03b3 Draconis is very well marked; also a radiant near \u03b3 Cephei (where another almost stationary meteor was observed); and one just below \u025b Pegasi, towards \u03b1 Aquarii; associated apparently with the last is a radiant near the small lozenge ini Delphinus, above \u03b1 Aquil\u00e6.","dc.creator":["CLARK, J.

H. Garrod, in NATURE, vol. viii. p. 265, the author states that in cold-blooded animals, nerve-force must be generated by the difference between their own temperatures and that of the medium by which they are surrounded. Now, to take the case of a frog as a common example of a \u201cso-called\u201d cold-blooded animal: A few days ago, when the thermometer was standing at 71\u00b0, I took the temperature of two frogs, one was 69\u00b0, and the other 67\u00b0; the difference between their temperature and that of the surrounding air was practically nil. Now, on a day of this Sort of temperature, it would seem that the pervious integument of the frog is continually exhaling moisture, and that in consequence the temperature falls, and would continue to fall below that of the surrounding air, were it not that it was raised by the heat generated. \u201cby the destruction of tissue that is continually going on within the body of the animal;\u201d so between these two contending forces a state of equilibrium results, and the temperature of the animal and the surrounding air are the same. But, if this be true, it follows that the whole of the heat from the animal is used up in keeping up its temperature, and therefore none can be spared for conversion into nerve-force. Therefore, a frog at rest on a summer's day ought to have no nervous energy. Now, suppose our frog takes to leaping vigorously, he will develop a certain amount of heat, and then he ought to have a great deal of nerve-force; but it is not found that an active frog is more \u201cnervous\u201d than a quiescent one.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"8","prism.number":"205","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"465","prism.endingPage":"465","prism.copyright":"1873 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/008465a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/008465a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/008465a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/008465a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"On the Origin of Nerve-Force","citation_volume":"8","citation_issue":"205","citation_publication_date":"1873/10","citation_firstpage":"465","citation_lastpage":"465","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/008465a0","DOI":"10.1038/008465a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/008465a0","description":"Is a paper on this subject, by Mr. A.

Now, to take the case of a frog as a common example of a \u201cso-called\u201d cold-blooded animal: A few days ago, when the thermometer was standing at 71\u00b0, I took the temperature of two frogs, one was 69\u00b0, and the other 67\u00b0; the difference between their temperature and that of the surrounding air was practically nil. Now, on a day of this Sort of temperature, it would seem that the pervious integument of the frog is continually exhaling moisture, and that in consequence the temperature falls, and would continue to fall below that of the surrounding air, were it not that it was raised by the heat generated. \u201cby the destruction of tissue that is continually going on within the body of the animal;\u201d so between these two contending forces a state of equilibrium results, and the temperature of the animal and the surrounding air are the same. But, if this be true, it follows that the whole of the heat from the animal is used up in keeping up its temperature, and therefore none can be spared for conversion into nerve-force. Therefore, a frog at rest on a summer's day ought to have no nervous energy. Now, suppose our frog takes to leaping vigorously, he will develop a certain amount of heat, and then he ought to have a great deal of nerve-force; but it is not found that an active frog is more \u201cnervous\u201d than a quiescent one.","dc.creator":["LYDEKKER, R."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["LYDEKKER, R."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"On the Origin of Nerve-Force","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;On the Origin of Nerve-Force&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"008487b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

So it is sometimes with the flowers of the cowslip and polyanthus, when they are borne on short stalks. This year the devastation has been greater than ever; and in a little wood not far from my house many hundred flowers have been destroyed, and some clumps have been completely denuded. For reasons presently to be given, I have no doubt that this is done by birds; and as I once saw some green-finches flying away from some primroses, I suspect that this is the enemy. The object of the birds in thus cutting off the flowers long perplexed me. As we have little water hereabouts, I at one time thought that it was done in order to squeeze the juice out of the stalks; but I have since observed that they are as frequently cut during very rainy, as during dry weather. One of my sons then suggested that the object was to get the nectar of the flowers; and I have no doubt that this is the right explanation. On a hasty glance it appears as if the foot-stalk had been cut through; but on close inspection, it will invariably be found that the extreme base of the calyx and the young ovary are left attached to the foot-stalk. And if the cut-off ends of the flowers be examined, it will be seen that they do not fit the narrow cutoff ends of the calyx, which remains attached to the stalk. A piece of the calyx between, one and two-tenths of an inch in length, has generally been cut clean away; and these little bits of the calyx can often be found on the ground; but sometimes they remain hanging by a few fibres to the upper part of the calyx of the detached flowers. Now no animal that I can think of, except a bird, could make two almost parallel clean cuts, transversely across the calyx of a flower. The part which is cut off contains within the narrow tube of the corolla the nectar; and the pressure of the bird's beak would force this out at both the cut-off ends. I have never heard of any bird in Europe feeding on nectar; though there are many that do so in the tropical parts of the New and Old Worlds, and which are believed to aid in the cross-fertilisation of the species. In such cases both the bird and the plant would profit. But with the primrose it is an unmitigated evil, and might well lead to its extermination; for in the wood above alluded to many hundred flowers have been destroyed this season, and cannot produce a single seed. My object in this communication to NATURE is to ask your correspondents in England and abroad to observe whether the primroses there suffer, and to state the result, whether negative or affirmative, adding whether primroses are abundant in each district. I cannot remember having formerly seen anything of the kind in the midland counties of England. If the habit of cutting off the flowers should prove, as seems probable, to be general, we must look at it as inherited or instinctive; for it is unlikely that each bird should have discovered during its individual life-time the exact spot where the nectar lies concealed within the tube of the corolla, and should have learnt to bite off the flowers so skilfully that a minute portion of the calyx is always left attached to the foot-stalk. If, on the other hand, the evil is confined to this part of Kent, it will be a curious case of a new habit or instinct arising in this primrose-decked land.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"9","prism.number":"234","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"482","prism.endingPage":"482","prism.copyright":"1874 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/009482a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/009482a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/009482a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/009482a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Flowers of the Primrose destroyed by Birds","citation_volume":"9","citation_issue":"234","citation_publication_date":"1874/04","citation_firstpage":"482","citation_lastpage":"482","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/009482a0","DOI":"10.1038/009482a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/009482a0","description":"FOR above twenty years I have observed every spring in my shrubberies and in the neighbouring woods, that a large number of the flowers of the primrose are cut off, and lie strewn on the ground close round the plants.

Many travellers have observed these visitants, and their records have proved valuable biological facts bearing on the occasional migrations of species and their consequences as has been pointed out by Mr. Darwin. But it is more than probable that this dispersal of land species over extremely wide areas of sea is far more constant and less occasional than we are at present justified in affirming from the facts as yet collected.

Anxious to confirm some observations made recently in the West Indies, in which I got from lightning a continuous spectrum, I took out my pocket spectroscope, and on looking through it was at once struck by the peculiarity of the spectrum. The band noticed by Prot. P. Smyth (vol. xii. pp. 231, 252) on the less refrangible side of D was very distinct, while the band (W.L.L. 5830\u20135680) on the more refrangible side of D was also very, though not nearly so dark, leaving the appearance of a bright yellow band over the part of the spectrum W.L.L. 5880\u20135830, as in the sunset spectrum, only much more marked. The A, B, and C lines were all visible; E and b were very sharp, b being easily separable into three lines; while there was also a dark band (W.L. 5040?) between b and F, but no lines visible beyond F. The most peculiar point, however, was the rapidity with which the spectrum varied, for, keeping the instrument pointed in one direction, each different cloud that passed differed in the intensity of the darkness of the band W.L.L. 5970\u20135900, which, sometimes could be distinctly separated from D, while at other times it appeared quite continuous with it. The darkest bands were given by the lurid purple and pillared white-grey clouds.

Anxious to confirm some observations made recently in the West Indies, in which I got from lightning a continuous spectrum, I took out my pocket spectroscope, and on looking through it was at once struck by the peculiarity of the spectrum. The band noticed by Prot. P. Smyth (vol. xii. pp. 231, 252) on the less refrangible side of D was very distinct, while the band (W.L.L. 5830\u20135680) on the more refrangible side of D was also very, though not nearly so dark, leaving the appearance of a bright yellow band over the part of the spectrum W.L.L. 5880\u20135830, as in the sunset spectrum, only much more marked. The A, B, and C lines were all visible; E and b were very sharp, b being easily separable into three lines; while there was also a dark band (W.L. 5040?) between b and F, but no lines visible beyond F. The most peculiar point, however, was the rapidity with which the spectrum varied, for, keeping the instrument pointed in one direction, each different cloud that passed differed in the intensity of the darkness of the band W.L.L. 5970\u20135900, which, sometimes could be distinctly separated from D, while at other times it appeared quite continuous with it. The darkest bands were given by the lurid purple and pillared white-grey clouds. During all this time the heat had been intense, and the thunder was accompanied by light gusts of wind varying as much as 90\u00b0 in direction, but about 1 o'clock rain began to fall and the abnormal bands to disappear. By 4 P.M. the band W.L.L. 5830\u20135680 was almost quite gone, and the band W.L.L. 5970\u20135900 had also become faint, appearing like a shadow cast by D, which was sharp and clear except in the light reflected from a few of the heaviest clouds.

At least I was quite aware of the cause, and that head or spine injuries had nothing to do with it.","dc.creator":["KINAHAN, G.

In all probability the mirror had warped in cooling, except in the thicker portions where the raised figures existed.","dc.creator":["PARNELL, J."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["PARNELL, J."],"citation_author_institution":["Hadham House, Upper Clapten"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Japanese Mirrors","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Japanese Mirrors&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"016248c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The experience of gardeners that the earth-worm injures pot plants may be based on the uncovering or mechanical tearing of the roots.","dc.creator":["KEY, HENRY COOPER"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["KEY, HENRY COOPER"],"citation_author_institution":["Hereford"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Earthworm in Relation to the Fertility of...","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Earthworm in Relation to the Fertility of the Soil&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"017081b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

I therefore annealed a stick of selenium about 2 cm. in length and 5 cm. in diameter, having previously melted into each end a platinum wire, and thus obtained a specimen which, though of very high resistance, was exceedingly sensitive to the action of light. The effect of diffused daylight was tested in the following manner:\u2014The specimen was placed in a glass box and connected directly with two Leclanche cells and a very delicate Thomson's galvanometer having a resistance of 6000 ohms; a deflection of, as far as I now remember, about 300 divisions of the scale was produced, and the light was then brought to zero by means of the adjusting magnet; a dark blind which had previously been drawn down was now pulled up, and the result was a deflection of about 100 divisions in the same direction as before. The glass box was placed three yards in front and a little to one side of the window, which was closed, and the sun at the time (about 4 p.m. July, 1877) was on the other side of the house. The selenium was then coated with shell-lac varnish, and about two hours afterwards again tested in the same manner as before, when the light was found to produce a deflection of 220 divisions, or more than twice the previous amount. The action of radiant heat was similar to that of light in the case of this particular specimen, but I have little doubt that any specimen may be rendered more sensitive to light by coating it with varnish or lampblack.

I hope that this suggestion will prove of service to those philosophers who may aspire to \u201chear a beam of light\u201d or to \u201csee by electricity,\u201d and shall be glad to hear that such has been the case.","dc.creator":["TOMLINSON, HERBERT"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["TOMLINSON, HERBERT"],"citation_author_institution":["King's College, Strand"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Photophone","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Photophone&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"023508a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

He forthwith showed me a naval telescope provided with a cap at the eye end containing a yellow glass, which could be removed at pleasure, I should like to know if the same simple contrivance has ever been used in our own navy.","dc.creator":["R."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["R."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Yellow Glass in Fog","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Yellow Glass in Fog&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"025077c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

These observations were taken inside the artificial cave of the above glacier in preference to the surface, as I thereby obtained a more direct measurement with a fixed point, as will be shown presently, and greater protection for the provisionary stations, made in the ice, against disturbances of fluctuating temperatures or the curiosity of visitors. The arrangement was very simple, namely: in the roof of the cave 2\u20143/4 in. round staves 2 feet long were fixed, at a relative angle of 45\u00b0, in such a way, that they prevented each other from dropping out, and were further clamped together by a small metal band, from which a plumb-bob was suspended. Below this, on the floor of the cave, was a boulder, firmly embedded in the earth, and unaffected by the ice; this constituted my fixed point, a line being cut on it to correspond with the centre of the bob. In this way any movement of the staves with the ice could easily be measured off. The following are some of the results obtained, and I would draw special attention to the fact that, although the valley narrows considerably towards the snout end of the glacier, and in consequence one would expect an increase in the flowing speed, the observations prove a decrease in speed to nearly one-third.

That these beams appeared dark is probably merely caused by the real \u201crayons\u201d being wide, with narrow, darker interspaces between. I have several times (see Phil. Mag., 1877) called attention to the existence of similar rays crossing the rainbow radially; indeed, it is seldom that a rainbow occurs when the sun is low in the sky, without one or more such rays being visible within the are. Two such rays, for example, were visible in a bow seen here at sunset two evenings ago. This bow was interesting in another way also; for, like the \u201cpink\u201d rainbows about which there was some correspondence in NATURE last year, the only colours visible (in the primary are) were red and yellow, the red being of a pinkish rather than a crimson hue.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"26","prism.number":"665","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"293","prism.endingPage":"293","prism.copyright":"1882 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/026293b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/026293b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/026293b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/026293b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"\u201cHalo\u201d: Pink Rainbow","citation_volume":"26","citation_issue":"665","citation_publication_date":"1882/07","citation_firstpage":"293","citation_lastpage":"293","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/026293b0","DOI":"10.1038/026293b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/026293b0","description":"THE appearance noted in NATURE this week (p. 268) by Prof. O'Reilly must surely have been a case of the rayons du cr\u00e9puscule that are frequently visible near sundown in the eastern sky.

That these beams appeared dark is probably merely caused by the real \u201crayons\u201d being wide, with narrow, darker interspaces between. I have several times (see Phil. Mag., 1877) called attention to the existence of similar rays crossing the rainbow radially; indeed, it is seldom that a rainbow occurs when the sun is low in the sky, without one or more such rays being visible within the are. Two such rays, for example, were visible in a bow seen here at sunset two evenings ago. This bow was interesting in another way also; for, like the \u201cpink\u201d rainbows about which there was some correspondence in NATURE last year, the only colours visible (in the primary are) were red and yellow, the red being of a pinkish rather than a crimson hue.","dc.creator":["THOMPSON, SILVANUS P."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["THOMPSON, SILVANUS P."],"citation_author_institution":["Pollokshields, Glasgow"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"\u201cHalo\u201d: Pink Rainbow","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&#8220;Halo&#8221;: Pink Rainbow&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"026366a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We were standing on the verandah of the house at the time, which is on the beach, and about forty feet above the level of the sea.","dc.creator":["HIGGINSON, WALTER","MANNING, B."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["HIGGINSON, WALTER","MANNING, B."],"citation_author_institution":["Quitta, West Coast Africa","Quitta, West Coast Africa"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Comet","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Comet&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"027030b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

NATHORST has certainly shown that many of the markings referred to Alg\u00e6 by some authors might be tracks left by moving animals on a soft mud, but is there reason to suppose that there are conditions under which submarine surfaces of very soft mud with minute tracks have, or could ever have been preserved. On the other hand there is no question about seaweed having existed in Pal\u00e6ozoic and Mesozoic times, and either some of the markings in question are their prints, or no traces of them are preserved. Now it is an uncontroverted fact that even the most indestructible of all vegetable tissue, that of the Conifer\u00e6, has been met with in the same condition of fossilisation, i.e. a projecting cast in sandstone on the under side of a slab, and without any internal trace of tissue or even of colouring due to carbon or iron, and Saporta has offered a satisfactory explanation of the origin of such casts. From the relative rarity with which terrestrial plants have been thus preserved, Nathorst almost derides Saporta's application of this explanation to fossil Alg\u00e6, yet it is by no means improbable that this may be their normal mode of preservation. The decay of dead olive-green seaweeds in water must be very rapid. The decomposition of some among them sets in almost immediately under water, and a colourless mucilaginous fluid is given off copiously. I have not watched the whole process of decay, but my impression is that the entire substance in some species would eventually pass away in a structureless glairy mass, and therefore that nothing but a hollow impression could ever be preserved. Casts of these would be more likely to be preserved in sand or mud than mere tracks, because the substance of the weed would occupy them, and prevent them from being immediately filled with the same quality of matrix as the surrounding rock, and until what would afterwards be a line of cleavage had been produced. So far therefore from its being exceptional for fossil seaweeds to appear as casts projecting from the under surface of the overlying mud, this is likely to be the normal condition in which fossil alg\u00e6 are preserved. This is apart altogether from the question whether any of the Pal\u00e6ozoic markings are Alg\u00e6, for, these differ so considerably from any existing forms, that in the absence of internal structure it is quite unlikely that there will be any general agreement respecting them. These observations do not apply to the Rhodosperme\u00e6, which scarcely enter into the question.

Archer as having cut a slit ia a felt hat was, as he believes, a garfish, a large Belone, not a Hemirhamphus, and not a swordfish or sawfish of any kind, as suggested by Mr. Goodsir. It is the constant habit of large Belones, some species of which attain, acording to Dr. G\u00fcnther, a length of five feet, when startled to move along the surface of the water by a series of rapid bounds for thirty or forty yards at a time, with astonishing rapidity. I have often seen them thus spring out of the water when scared by a boat. I was told that in some of the Pacific Islands these fish not uncommonly cause the death of the natives, who, when wading in the water, have their naked abdomens speared by the sharp snoats of the fish, with the result of causing peritonitis. The fish appear to bound blindly away from danger, and strike any obstacle in their way haphazard. As a good many natives wade in together in many of their fishing operations, as at Fiji, for example, where one party drives the fish into the nets held by another, such accidents may easily occur. I do not think a sawfish could possibly jump over a boat.

As a good many natives wade in together in many of their fishing operations, as at Fiji, for example, where one party drives the fish into the nets held by another, such accidents may easily occur. I do not think a sawfish could possibly jump over a boat. I have described the jumping habits of the large garfish, and alluded to their fatal effects in \u201cNotes by a Naturalist on the Challenger\u201d, p. 480.","dc.creator":["MOSELEY, H.

If a reviewer in a signed review cannot express freely his opinion upon a book without its being suggested that he is actuated by secondary and sinister motives, I fancy that few men of common honesty would care to continue the work of reviewing. Moreover, in the present instance the imputation of animus seems to me specially unjustifiable. I had almost forgotten the correspondence in NATURE to which the Duke alludes, but on now referring to it again I can only see that, if it was provocative of animus, there was assuredly no reason for the animus to have arisen on my side (see NATURE, vol. xxiv. pp. 581 and 604; vol. xxv. pp. 6 and 29). But, to ignore so unworthy a charge, and one which I can only suppose to have been made under a sense of irritation, I must explain that the Duke is under a wrong impression when he assumes that my objection to his advocacy of Theistic belief is due to what he regards as my aversion to Theism. As I have never been in the habit of \u201cusing your columns for the purpose of inculcating personal beliefs and disbeliefs on subjects which lie outside the boundaries of physical science,\u201d I shall not do so now. But in view of the slender grounds on which the Duke has felt himself entitled to infer that I \u201chold that the highest aim of the human intellect is to prove the mindlessness of nature,\u201d I feel it is desirable to correct the inference. For this purpose it is not needful that I should publish my \u201cpersonal beliefs and disbeliefs.\u201d It is only needful to say that my previous remarks will be found to have been directed, not against the cause of Theism, but against its champion in the Duke of Argyll. Had my sympathies been more on the side of the materialists than they happen to be, the Duke of Argyll might not have found so much reason to quarrel with my \u201cdislike\u201d of his advocacy.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"29","prism.number":"754","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"548","prism.endingPage":"548","prism.copyright":"1884 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029548a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/029548a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029548a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029548a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"\u201cThe Unity of Nature\u201d","citation_volume":"29","citation_issue":"754","citation_publication_date":"1884/04","citation_firstpage":"548","citation_lastpage":"548","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/029548a0","DOI":"10.1038/029548a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/029548a0","description":"I REGRET that the Duke of Argyll should have been led by anything that I have written to make some of the remarks which appear in this week's issue of NATURE (p. 524).

I had almost forgotten the correspondence in NATURE to which the Duke alludes, but on now referring to it again I can only see that, if it was provocative of animus, there was assuredly no reason for the animus to have arisen on my side (see NATURE, vol. xxiv. pp. 581 and 604; vol. xxv. pp. 6 and 29). But, to ignore so unworthy a charge, and one which I can only suppose to have been made under a sense of irritation, I must explain that the Duke is under a wrong impression when he assumes that my objection to his advocacy of Theistic belief is due to what he regards as my aversion to Theism. As I have never been in the habit of \u201cusing your columns for the purpose of inculcating personal beliefs and disbeliefs on subjects which lie outside the boundaries of physical science,\u201d I shall not do so now. But in view of the slender grounds on which the Duke has felt himself entitled to infer that I \u201chold that the highest aim of the human intellect is to prove the mindlessness of nature,\u201d I feel it is desirable to correct the inference. For this purpose it is not needful that I should publish my \u201cpersonal beliefs and disbeliefs.\u201d It is only needful to say that my previous remarks will be found to have been directed, not against the cause of Theism, but against its champion in the Duke of Argyll. Had my sympathies been more on the side of the materialists than they happen to be, the Duke of Argyll might not have found so much reason to quarrel with my \u201cdislike\u201d of his advocacy.","dc.creator":["ROMANES, GEORGE J."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["ROMANES, GEORGE J."],"citation_author_institution":["London"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"\u201cThe Unity of Nature\u201d","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&#8220;The Unity of Nature&#8221;&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"029550c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It is incorrect to declare that I advocated before the Committee on Naval Designs, in 1871, the system of construction upon which the ships of the Admiral class are built. The Ajax, Agamemnon, Colossus, and Edinburgh are designed upon a citadel system which I originally devised and advocated under certain limitations; but I deny, and always have denied, that any of those ships conformed to the fundamental and indispensable condition which I laid down as part of my system: viz. that the armoured citadel should be of ample dimensions to command the whole structure, keeping it afloat and upright, notwithstanding any amount of injury to the unarmoured ends. As this system has been violated in all the four ships above-mentioned, it is most unfair and improper to state that even those vessels are constructed upon a system which I advocated. But as regards the ships of the Admiral class they do not at all conform to the system which I advised, and the writer of the article in question could only have supposed them to do so from a serious misapprehension of the ships themselves. The article stated that the central part of all the ships in question, including the Admiral class, are \u201cplated completely around with very thick armour, which extends from the upper deck to several feet below the water-line.\u201d This is a very incorrect description of the Admiral class, the armour in which does not rise to the upper deck at all, but is stopped in the form of a shallow belt rising but a foot or two, or possibly slightly more, above the water's surface. I repudiate with indignation the statement that such a system of construction as this, in association with the long unarmoured ends of the Admiral class, was ever recommended by me. For this reason I complain likewise of the statement in your article to the effect that my recent letter to the Times is but a continuation of the old and well-remembered Inflexible debate. So far is this from being so, that I distinctly pointed out in that letter that the cutting down of the armour to a mere belt of short length separated the ships of the Admiral class from the others, and imported \u201ca new and terrible cause of danger.\u201d Another statement of which I complain, and which I desire to have corrected, is to the effect that I \u201crefused to give evidence\u201d before the Inflexible Committee, Were this true, it would constitute, in my judgment, a most serious ground of complaint against me, but it is not true. The Inflexible Report and its Appendices clearly exhibit the fact that within two days of the appointment of the Committee, and on the very day on which my evidence was asked for by the Committee, I handed in to that body a most claborate mass of evidence, occupying no less than eighteen columns of the Inflexible Report, and illustrated by two sheets of drawings, this evidence setting forth in great detail my views of the subject, and the grounds of my dissatisfaction with such ships. It is true that four months later I was asked by telegram to attend the Committee, but asked to be excused on the ground that I objected to take part in the dilatory proceedings of the Committee, which I regarded as frustrating the objects with which it was demanded by Parliament. My full evidence was, however, already before the Committee, and had been for several months.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"31","prism.number":"802","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"432","prism.endingPage":"432","prism.copyright":"1885 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/031432a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/031432a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/031432a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/031432a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Relative Efficiency of War Ships","citation_volume":"31","citation_issue":"802","citation_publication_date":"1885/03","citation_firstpage":"432","citation_lastpage":"432","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/031432a0","DOI":"10.1038/031432a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/031432a0","description":"I HAVE a complaint to make against certain of the statements made in the article upon \u201cThe Relative Efficiency of War Ships,\u201d which appeared in your number for February 26.

It must have been a minute or two in view, as I had time to stop walking and watch it describe a long track.

Only a few weeks ago I received from my friend Dr. J. Barbosa Rodriguez, the learned and energetic Director of the Museu Botanico do Amazonas, at Mana\u00f3s, a very fine specimen of the Lepidosiren, captured some time last August in that neighbourhood. This specimen is well preserved in alcohol; it measures 85 centimetres in length, with a girth behind the pectorals of 28 centimetres. On opening it I found that it is a female, the ovaries being well laden with well-developed ova; unfortunately the alcohol had not been let into the visceral cavity, and none of the internal organs were in a condition to be successfully investigated. I found the pericardium singularly large and thick. The body is cylindrical, but quite flat along the abdominal surface, where the scales are also bigger, thicker, and of a lighter colour. The short caudal region is much compressed. There are no true median fins except the irregularly rounded caudal, which extends merely as a slightly marked keel to about the middle of the back. The fin-rays on the caudal portion are close together, cartilaginous, and quite hidden by the skin; pectorals and ventrals without traces of membranous edging and rays; the former are slender and compressed, the latter conical and considerably stouter. The entire body, except the head in front of the eyes and the paired fins, is covered with moderate cycloid scales\u2014thicker, as I observed, on the abdominal cuirasse, extending from the chin to the anus and composed of about ten longitudinal rows of scales. Except along this ventral stripe, which is of a whitish colour, the animal is generally of a dark brownish purple, with darker indistinct blotches. The double lateral line is dark; it reticulates on the cheeks and around the eyes. These are quite rudimentary, and show under the skin as a whitish spot; they remind me of the eyes of the two Gymnotus which I saw alive in the Insect House at the London Zoological Gardens last October. The branchial openings are very narrow, protected by a thick fleshy flap: there are no traces of external branchial appendages, indeed, even the internal branchi\u00e6 cannot be seen through the deep, narrow, branchial slit. The mouth is terminal, with well-developed fleshy lips; there are two small conical vomerine teeth; the maxillary and mandibular dental plates are very similar in size and shape; fleshy pads fit into the spaces between the dental ridges. The tongue is thick, smooth, and fleshy, with a rounded point. Four branchial clefts can be made out on each side in the pharynx, the fourth is much reduced; the three free branchial arches are fringed with conical papill\u00e6. The palate and mucous membrane of the mouth is white and quite smooth; the pads along the dental plates are papillous. The anus is exactly 10 millimetres on the left of the mesial line; it is 8 millimetres in diameter, and surrounded with a border in deep folds. I had forgotten to mention the nostrils: both pairs are inside the mouth; the anterior ones, just within the upper lip, are ovoid, transverse, without flap or valve; the posterior pair are situated just outside the hinder ridge of the maxillary dental plate, they are ovoid and longitudinal.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"35","prism.number":"902","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"343","prism.endingPage":"343","prism.copyright":"1887 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/035343a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/035343a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/035343a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/035343a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"\u201cLepidosiren paradoxa\u201d","citation_volume":"35","citation_issue":"902","citation_publication_date":"1887/02","citation_firstpage":"343","citation_lastpage":"343","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/035343a0","DOI":"10.1038/035343a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/035343a0","description":"ZOOLOGISTS will be interested to hear of the capture of a fine specimen of this the rarest of the Dipnoi.

M. Petersen, R.N. During the morning hours of August 7, I was on shore at Gandfjord, on the south side of the Varangerfjord, and measured the height of some terraces there. At 1h. 10m. p.m. we took serial temperatures in the Gandfjord with the deep-sea thermometer. The weather was calm, and a dense fog prevailed. The temperature of the air was 12\u00b0 C. Leaving the Gandfjord we proceeded northwards. The dense fog continued. At once the fog began to be lighter and the sun to shine through, and a few minutes afterwards we were out of the fog, which was standing as a white wall in the south-west. In the moment the sun appeared, but before we were quite clear of the fog, I saw in the north-east a bow having the shape of a rainbow, but quite white, projected on the fog. With a sextant I measured its amplitude, or the chord along the horizon, and the height of the summit above the horizon\u2014in both cases the middle between the outer and inner edge of the bow. The horizon not being distinctly visible, it is probable that the measures taken do not exactly refer to the true horizon, nor is it certain that the height of the summit was taken from the same horizontal plane in which the amplitude was measured. By the captain's reckoning, the apparent ship's time, at the moment of observation, was 2h. 40m., and the latitude 70\u00b0 1\u2032. From these data, and the declination of the sun, I computed the azimuth of the sun at south 46\u00b0 5\u2032 west, and its apparent altitude at 31\u00b0 12\u2032. Supposing, as the results of the several computations tend to indicate, that the white bow is circular, and has its centre in the anthelic point, we may calculate the angular radius of the bow by three different methods.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.publicationDate":"1888-02-01","prism.volume":"37","prism.number":"956","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"391","prism.endingPage":"392","prism.copyright":"1888 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/037391a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/037391a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/037391a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/037391a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Fog Bow and Ulloa's Ring","citation_volume":"37","citation_issue":"956","citation_publication_date":"1888/02","citation_online_date":"1888/02/01","citation_firstpage":"391","citation_lastpage":"392","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/037391a0","DOI":"10.1038/037391a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/037391a0","description":"IN the summer of 1875, I made a tour of inspection to our meteorological stations in the surveying-steamer Hansteen, Capt.

Most snakes swim well, but who of us has not been surprised upon first observing the violent wriggling, froward-propelling motions of some of the smaller lizards when they are thrown out into the water some little distance from the shore? The American chameleon (Anolis principalis) well illustrates this last; and this lizard, in common with others, seems to possess an actual dread of getting into deep water. For a long time it has been known that most species of the so-considered stricter types of land tortoises soon drown when placed in water of any considerable depth, and it would be but natural to suppose that such species would avoid that element as far as possible, but I have found this by no means always to be the case. Take the ordinary land turtle of the United States (Cistudo carolina for example: it will voluntarily enter the water under certain circumstances. Not long ago the writer noticed one of these hunting for food in three or four inches of water along the edge of a pond that had rising banks; and the first time I discovered the nest of this variety the eggs were deposited in the water in a depression at the miry margin of a marsh. But this is not all, for if we place one of these reptiles upon a little island of land, well removed from the shore, and surrounded by water several feet in depth, and withdraw to watch its movements, we note that as soon as it satisfies itself as to its position, it will, without further ado, take at once to the water and swim to the nearest shore. It does not, however, sink beneath the surface, but, holding its head high out of that element, and filling its lungs with air, strikes out vigorously, with alternate pairs of feet, until it accomplishes its purpose, and regains the mainland. How far one could swim in this manner I am unable to state, but that it would not exceed a few yards I am quite certain. Nevertheless, even the power to accomplish the feat to the extent indicated might, under a variety of circumstances, have its influence upon the distribution of the species, or of any species of typical land tortoise, and it would be interesting to know how far this power may be enjoyed by this class of reptiles generally.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"40","prism.number":"1044","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"644","prism.endingPage":"644","prism.copyright":"1889 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/040644a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/040644a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/040644a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/040644a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"On the Aquatic Habits of Certain Land Tortoises","citation_volume":"40","citation_issue":"1044","citation_publication_date":"1889/10","citation_firstpage":"644","citation_lastpage":"644","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/040644a0","DOI":"10.1038/040644a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/040644a0","description":"IT has always proved of more or less interest to me to observe the method of aquatic locomotion adopted on the part of any of our strictly terrestrial vertebrates, and never is this more keen than when the opportunity has been afforded to study the swimming propensities of certain of our Reptilia.

Association, vol. i. 1889, p. 213), and it is seen from his description that, as also in the cases of Dorippe, Pagurus, Dromia vulgaris, &c., the foreign substances or animals become attached to the body not by accident but by the act of the crabs themselves.","dc.creator":["GARSTANG, WALTER"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["GARSTANG, WALTER"],"citation_author_institution":["Laboratory of the Marine Biological Association, Plymouth"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Foreign Substances Attached to Crabs","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Foreign Substances Attached to Crabs&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"041462b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The fact has been well known for many years, and was first observed by Dr. Bowditch, of Harvard. In a private letter to me dated March 13, 1876, Dr. Bowditch wrote:\u2014\u201cA comparison of the rates of growth of boys and girls shows that in this community girls about 13 years of age are taller and heavier than boys of the same age, and I wish to see how far this is the case in other countries. Quetelet's observations seem to show that it is not the case in Belgium, but some English observations quoted by him indicate that among certain classes of the population in England the same thing is found.\u201d Again, on June 10, 1876, he wrote:\u2014\u201cI am exceedingly obliged to you for your letter of April 27, and for the statistics which it contains. It is very interesting to get a confirmation of my observation on the difference between the two sexes about 13 years of age.

Do you understand that the elaborate tables given in his \u2018Anthropometrie,\u2019 p. 417, rest entirely on this small number of observations?\u201d In his paper on \u201cThe Growth of Children,\u201d published the following year (1877), Prof. Bowditch demonstrated the fact by both tables and diagrams; and in my \u201cManual of Anthropometry\u201d (1878), and in the Reports of the Anthropometric Committee of the British Association (1880\u201383), I have given similar evidence of the difference of the sexes in this country. The English tables published by Quetelet mentioned by Dr. Bowditch refer to factory children, and were collected by Stanway, and published in a Report of the Factory Commission so long ago as 1833. Quetelet makes his curves of growth of boys and girls meet at the age of 12 years, but at all other ages the girls are shorter than the boys, but his ten observations (on selected individuals?) at each age were not sufficient to bring out the true difference. The only novelty in the German observations is that the boys do not \u201ccatch up\u201d the girls quite so early as they do in England and America. This point, however, can only be decided by a comparison of the actual measurements of the German with those of the English and American children.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"42","prism.number":"1086","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"390","prism.endingPage":"390","prism.copyright":"1890 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/042390a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/042390a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/042390a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/042390a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Relative Growth of Boys and Girls","citation_volume":"42","citation_issue":"1086","citation_publication_date":"1890/08","citation_firstpage":"390","citation_lastpage":"390","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/042390a0","DOI":"10.1038/042390a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/042390a0","description":"A \u201cNOTE\u201d in NATURE of August 14 (p. 376) referring to so measurements made by Herren Geisler and Ulitzsch on school children at Freiberg (Saxon), speaks of the fact that between the ages of 11 and 16 years girls are taller than boys as if it had not been previously observed and recorded.

Do you understand that the elaborate tables given in his \u2018Anthropometrie,\u2019 p. 417, rest entirely on this small number of observations?\u201d In his paper on \u201cThe Growth of Children,\u201d published the following year (1877), Prof. Bowditch demonstrated the fact by both tables and diagrams; and in my \u201cManual of Anthropometry\u201d (1878), and in the Reports of the Anthropometric Committee of the British Association (1880\u201383), I have given similar evidence of the difference of the sexes in this country. The English tables published by Quetelet mentioned by Dr. Bowditch refer to factory children, and were collected by Stanway, and published in a Report of the Factory Commission so long ago as 1833. Quetelet makes his curves of growth of boys and girls meet at the age of 12 years, but at all other ages the girls are shorter than the boys, but his ten observations (on selected individuals?) at each age were not sufficient to bring out the true difference. The only novelty in the German observations is that the boys do not \u201ccatch up\u201d the girls quite so early as they do in England and America. This point, however, can only be decided by a comparison of the actual measurements of the German with those of the English and American children.","dc.creator":["ROBERTS, CHARLES"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["ROBERTS, CHARLES"],"citation_author_institution":["Mayfair"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Relative Growth of Boys and Girls","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Relative Growth of Boys and Girls&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"042456c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The fact remains that the motion of even an endless band has not necessarily anything to do with the stability of the straight part. Dr. Lodge apparently still wishes us to suppose otherwise.","dc.creator":["WORTHINGTON, A.

Where I reside are three Irish servants, to whom I caused to be shown a drawing of the Water Newt, and with the request that I might be told its name, and anything they knew about it One of these, a Galway woman, speaking Irish better than English, gave me the name in her language (which I won't attempt to transcribe, for it was a very long one), and also said that the animals were well known to jump down people's throats to their certain de struction.","dc.creator":["BUSHE, C."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["BUSHE, C."],"citation_author_institution":["Athenr\u00e6um"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Superstitions of the Shuswaps of British Columbia","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Superstitions of the Shuswaps of British Columbia&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"047200a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Both the elements already exist as minerals in nature; and one might just as well say that the silver mineralised the sulphur.","dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"A Review Reviewed","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;A Review Reviewed&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"050297a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Wang Chung, the philosopher (circa 27\u201397 A.D.), in his work, renowned for its total repudiation of the then current errors, writes as follows:\u2014\u201cIn the \u2018Book of Poems\u2019 it is said, \u2018Ki-ming(Phosphor)exists in the east, and Chang-kang(Hesper) in the west.\u2019 In fact, however, they are but the phases of Jupiter and Venus, which, appearing now in the east, now in the west, received such distinct names from the ignorant bards\u201d (\u201cLun-hang,\u201d Miura's edition, Ky\u00f4to, 1748, torn. xvii. pp. 12\u201313). Two facts are manifested in this passage. First, it shows that, celebrated for their astronomical acquirements in very archaic ages, as they are, the fact that the evening and morning stars are the same body, was not known to the Chinese of the eighth century B.C., when the poem entitled \u201c Ta-tung\u201d was composed, comprising the above-quoted line. Secondly, it shows that, even after the identity was established of the evening and morning stars, some Chinese, so well learned as Wang Chung, were ignorant of their own error: affirming that Jupiter as well as Venus appears now as Phosphor, now as Hesper, they have admitted the existence of two distinct Phosphori and two distinct Hesperi, and of a Phosphor essentially different from a Hesper. It is probable that some later scholars have tried to evade this intricacy by arbitrarily apportioning the two phases between the two planets; thus, Minamoto-no-Shita-zau, the Japanese poet and glossarist (909\u2013983 A.D.), referring to a Chinese work \u201c Kien-ming-yuen,\u201d which is perhaps lost now, identifies Jupiter (in Chinese: Sui-sing) with Phosphor (in Japanese: Aka-boshi), and Venus (in Chinese: Tai-peh) with Hesper (in Japanese: Y\u00dbtsutsu) (\u201cWamy\u00f4 Ruijush\u00f4,\u201d Nawa's edition, Ky\u00f4to, 1667, torn. i. p. 1).","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"51","prism.number":"1322","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"417","prism.endingPage":"417","prism.copyright":"1895 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/051417a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/051417a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/051417a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/051417a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Hesper and Phosphor","citation_volume":"51","citation_issue":"1322","citation_publication_date":"1895/02","citation_firstpage":"417","citation_lastpage":"417","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/051417a0","DOI":"10.1038/051417a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/051417a0","description":"IN his \u201cHistory of the Inductive Sciences\u201d(vol. i. p. 149, London, 1847), Whewell says:\u2014\u201cPythagoras is said to have maintained that the evening and morning stars are the same body, which certainly must have been one of the earliest discoveries on this subject; and indeed, we can hardly conceive men noticing the stars for a year or two without coming to this conclusion\u201d (cf. \u201cThe Planet Venus,\u201d by W.

When the sun was about a few degrees from the horizon (the horizon at the place of observation was not the true one, for a large but not very distant hill intervenes towards the west), there seemed to be suddenly formed a halo of peculiar shape. Its form may be described as nearly, if not quite, parabolic, the axis of the parabola being vertical.

The weather that day had been beautifully fine, but towards 5h. p.m. (Mean European Time) thin light clouds began to form, which covered the heavens with a thin white raiment. When the sun was about a few degrees from the horizon (the horizon at the place of observation was not the true one, for a large but not very distant hill intervenes towards the west), there seemed to be suddenly formed a halo of peculiar shape. Its form may be described as nearly, if not quite, parabolic, the axis of the parabola being vertical. Curiously enough, this parabolic form was not symmetrical with regard to the position of the sun, but the latter was situated some distance to the north of the axis.

As I stated in the concluding paragraph of my last letter (p. 293), \"It is evident that there are several distinct kinds of greenness in oysters.\" Amongst these I cited Dr. Thorpe's recent demonstration of notable amounts of copper in oysters from Falmouth; so it can scarcely be said that I \" appear to doubt the occurrence of copper.\" Dr. Charles Kohn has kindly re-investigated the matter for me lately, and has determined the amounts of both copper and iron present in various kinds of oysters by electrolytic methods. He finds the green Marennes oyster contains about 0.4 mgrme. (say.006 grains) of copper, which agrees pretty closely with the figures given by previous writers. This seems to be the normal amount present in all oysters, white or green, and due to the h\u00e6mocyanin of the blood. Dr. Thorpe, however, finds that the green Falmouth oysters have, on the average, each.023 grains of copper, which falls to the normal amount (.006) on re-laying in another locality, and which is \"obviously caused by the mechanical retention of cupriferous particles\" (Thorpe, NATURE, p. 107). If Dr. Thorpe means by this that copper mud is entangled in the water and food passages of the oyster, is it not possible that, although the oyster is green, and copper is present, the colour may be due\u2014as in most green oysters\u2014to another cause? This mere entanglement (more or less accidental) of copper-bearing material in the passages of the oyster may also be the explanation of the extraordinarily high figure reported by Mr. Lowe\u2014a figure (.04 grammes) as large, I may remark, as that of the total ash in the case of some of my oysters investigated by Dr. Kohn.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"55","prism.number":"1425","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"366","prism.endingPage":"367","prism.copyright":"1897 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/055366d0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/055366d0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/055366d0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/055366d0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Oysters and Copper","citation_volume":"55","citation_issue":"1425","citation_publication_date":"1897/02","citation_firstpage":"366","citation_lastpage":"367","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/055366d0","DOI":"10.1038/055366d0","citation_doi":"10.1038/055366d0","description":"I AM interested to hear of Mr. Lowe's case, where he considers the oysters from near Swansea owe their colour to a very considerable amount of copper.

The shaft of light successively appeared and disappeared at intervals of a few seconds, and each time further eastwards, but each section was separated from the last by a space of unilluminated sky, as if there were regular spaces in the course of the beam incapable of being set aglow. Very soon after passing overhead the illumination became faint and disappeared eastwards, but now a strong glow appeared again near the horizon under a cloud south-west by west, and this rapidly grew upwards, repeating the phenomenon described in the first case. This occurred at least eleven or twelve times with little variation, except that the shaft became broader and more diffuse. The glow near the horizon south-westwards was always, followed by the passage of the light across the sky within 1 to 1\u00bd mins., and each travelling beam was separated from the last by an interval of 1\u00bd to 2 mins. Meanwhile the sky north-westwards showed a pale white steady auroral light, which was at first attributed to the remains of twilight, but which continued to increase till about 8.30, when it was sufficiently strong to cast shadows and to show large print distinctly. This illumination extended slowly upwards from the north until it covered a great part of the sky up to the zenith, and seemed to be due to the luminosity of the great sheet of cirrus and cirrostratus which had covered the sky since 3.30 p.m., for it exactly imitated the distribution forms of the cloud which I had noted during the afternoon. This cloud, unilluminated, did not appreciably obscure the stars. The lacun\u00e6 of dark interspaces, while the surrounding sky shone with pale light, resembled bands or puffs of dark smoke, but remained fixed in the same situation, and altogether the phenomenon was strangely persistent, the only evident changes being a gradual shifting from north-west to north-east, and at about 9 p.m. a rosy streak north-eastwards. A little later fresh rays were shooting up from north-west by west, somewhat resembling those which an hour previously had emerged from south-west by west, but more steady and unbroken. At 9.55 a faint light was still to be seen in a north-westerly direction. Two hours before this grand exhibition we had been able to get a good view of the large spot on the sun, the intervening bank of cirriform cloud making his appearance through a telescope more like that of the moon. I have not seen any authoritative statements as to interruption of telegraphic messages or other magnetic disturbances coincident with or preceding the visible aurora, but no doubt some effect must have been observed.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"58","prism.number":"1508","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"496","prism.endingPage":"496","prism.copyright":"1898 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/058496b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/058496b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/058496b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/058496b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Aurora of September 9","citation_volume":"58","citation_issue":"1508","citation_publication_date":"1898/09","citation_firstpage":"496","citation_lastpage":"496","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/058496b0","DOI":"10.1038/058496b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/058496b0","description":"THIS evening, at about three minutes past eight, on looking out towards the south-west, I was struck by the appearance of a shaft of white light stretching from that direction upwards towards a point 10\u00b0 or 20\u00b0 south of the zenith, and immediately on reaching open ground, whence a wide view was obtained, became aware that a fine display of aurora borealis was in progress.

This last assumption is, however, opposed to the entire spirit of Mr. Cunningham's book, the whole burden of which is that there has been dissimilarity of \u201cstimulation\u201d between the sexes.","dc.creator":["MELDOLA, R."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["MELDOLA, R."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Sexual Dimorphism","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Sexual Dimorphism&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"063347a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The light column then, when I first saw it, was yellow coloured, bright and narrow at the base, but more diffused above, where it could be traced up to a length of 5\u00b0 or 6\u00b0, while its base rested upon, or extended very little, if at all, below the sun. The summit grew narrower and higher as the sun descended lower, while the base became brighter and followed the sun down until, at about ten or fifteen minutes to 8, the sun was much dulled in light and assumed an orange yellow colour in entering a bank of haze about 5\u00b0 from the horizon. Below that altitude the light-column's base never descended; but when at about 8 p.m. the sun had acquired the magnificent appearance of a great crimson disc, still about 2\u00b0, or some four of its diameters, clear from the level park horizon, the tall column shone beautifully above it as a perfectly straight, vertical, narrow streak of light about the sun's apparent diameter in width and 8\u00b0 or 10\u00b0 in length (from about altitude 5\u00b0 to altitude 15\u00b0, and very faintly rather higher), bright yellow at its base, but becoming insensibly whiter and dimmer, without lateral diffusion till lost across the faint cloud-streaks which seemed here and there just visibly to lengthen it and very faintly extend it somewhat higher. It shortened gradually, and died out at last about 8h. 10m. p.m., soon after the sun itself vanished in the haze before reaching the horizon, but without changing the altitude, about 5\u00b0, of its base; and it retained to the last the straight, vertical appearance of which many of the vast number of people enjoying the fine evening in the extensive park were admiring watchers.

While walking up and down the platform of a railway station, he noticed a peculiarity in the sound of a steam jet from an engine standing on the lines. The pitch of the sound appeared to rise as he retreated from the engine and to fall as he drew near to it. Some time after, Mr. Simpson observed the same thing again, but in this instance the noise was made by a gas flare in the open air, about which some men were at work. Since then I have found that this alteration of pitch with distance occurs with any fizzing noise of the kind, such as that of air jets, burning logs, frying fat, pouring rice or coffee beans, waterfalls, or even the rustling leaves of a single tree; with all those noises, in fact, whose sources are sufficiently localised to admit of observations of the kind being made. I found, also, on withdrawing from such a source that a point is reached after which the pitch ceases to rise, and remains practically stationary as far onward as the sound continues audible. This point is sometimes pretty definitely marked, and varies in distance from the source with different sounds, and the pitch of the stationary portion also varies in the same way. I do not think, however, that the pitch of the whole volume of sound changes, though it often appears to do so, for a similar impression is created by moving a fizzing air jet to and fro close to a wall. As it nears the wall, the whole sound seems gradually to rise in pitch and to sink again as the jet is withdrawn. But here the effect is clearly due to successive reinforcement of one part of the noise after another in the order of their wave-lengths. It is only a shifting of the point of greatest intensity, and not an actual change of pitch at all. Assuming, then, that the effect noticed by Mr. Simpson is of the same nature, that is to say, caused by a readjustment of the relative intensity of the parts, how is it to be accounted for? Is it simply a process of sifting by distance, the weaker groups of small noises, of which the fizzing sound is composed, dropping out of earshot in succession, as the observer retires from the source, till only the largest and loudest group is left, which last continues to be heard for the remainder of the distance without sensible change of pitch? If that is so, then the deeper tones of such noises would seem to have a proportionally shorter range of audibility than the higher ones; for, so far as I have observed, the pitch always sinks on approach to the source and rises on withdrawal from it, never the reverse way, as might be expected in the case of very bass roaring sounds. Perhaps, however, others may have noticed instances of the latter sort. The behaviour of the airjet fizz at the wall illustrates a kind of reciprocal action, which no doubt plays an important part in the adjustment of the pitch. The tone which is loudest for the moment appears to dominate and obscure the rest, so that, near the source, where the deeper tones are most powerful, these latter, to some extent, subdue and lower the principal one, while further off, where they become enfeebled by distance, they are in their turn still more diminished by the presence of the principal far-reaching tone.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"65","prism.number":"1676","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"129","prism.endingPage":"129","prism.copyright":"1901 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/065129a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/065129a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/065129a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/065129a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Change of Pitch in certain Sounds with Distance","citation_volume":"65","citation_issue":"1676","citation_publication_date":"1901/12","citation_firstpage":"129","citation_lastpage":"129","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/065129a0","DOI":"10.1038/065129a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/065129a0","description":"SEVERAL years ago the late Prebendary Simpson, of Fittleworth, Sussex, told me of an interesting observation he had made, which some of your readers may be able to explain.

Including the horsetails and ferns with the flowering plants, probably about 575 species are identical in Canada and Europe, and again about 330 in Canada and Japan or the River Amur country. A large number of these are common to the three continents. The hypothesis generally accepted has been that, in some comparatively recent epochs, there has been a connection between Europe and America which facilitated the intermingling of the plant life of the two continents. The late Prof. Asa Gray suggested the probability that the migration of European plants had taken place across Asia to America. Lesquereux, from his studies of the flora of the Dakota group, on the other hand, maintained that the North American flora is not now, nor has it been in past geological ages, the result of migration, but that it is indigenous. It has long been known that species now extinct occurring in the Miocene of Europe had appeared in America at an earlier period. Lester Ward enumerates eleven species\u2014all now extinct\u2014as common to the Laramie group in the United States and the Eocene of Europe, and shows further that at least two living species now found in both Japan and America date their origin in America as far back as the Eocene. Twenty years ago my own studies in the distribution of Canadian plants also convinced me that whilst facilities had existed for migration in both an easterly and a westerly direction, Canada was the point of origin of many of the species now identical in Europe and America. This conviction has been heightened by further knowledge of the range in Canada of these identical species and by further discoveries during recent years of plants in the Pleistocene clays of Canada. Of seventy fossil species in these Pleistocene clays at Toronto, Ottawa and elsewhere, twenty occur at the present day in both Europe and Canada, fourteen are similarly Asiatic and Canadian, whilst eleven are common to the three continents. This, if it does not necessarily indicate that in Pleistocene times the intermingling of these floras had already been effected, at least shows that in this period these identical species were present in Canada, and had here their place of origin if there is nothing to indicate their presence at as early a period in Europe or Asia. In its vast areas of exposed Laurentian and Huronian formations, Canada has an old look about it, and must have furnished a home through long past ages for the growth and diffusion of northern temperate plant life, when other sections of the globe have from time to time been under water.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"70","prism.number":"1803","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"55","prism.endingPage":"55","prism.copyright":"1904 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/070055b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/070055b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/070055b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/070055b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Origin of Plants Common to Europe and America","citation_volume":"70","citation_issue":"1803","citation_publication_date":"1904/05","citation_firstpage":"55","citation_lastpage":"55","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/070055b0","DOI":"10.1038/070055b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/070055b0","description":"THAT there is a resemblance between the floras of Canada and northern Europe, and again between the floras of Canada and of eastern Siberia and Japan, is well known.

If the stresses and are zero in the case of the plate, then the stresses which are developed when the lamina forms part of the complete structure cannot, themselves, give rise to any such shears as or and as the dam is not constrained at top or flanks, it is difficult to see how, in the absence of these shears, the stresses and can be affected. Certainly not by the 30 per cent, which Prof. Pearson gives as the order of the error.","dc.creator":["MARTIN, H.

In speaking of explanation in terms of force and action-at-a-distance, or in terms of motion and a continuous medium, Sir Oliver says that \u201cTo Lord Kelvin it would appear that both solutions were equally satisfactory, and that it was only a question of which was the most tractable\u201d. It is the word \u201cequally\u201d which is rather strong.

The amount of this was approximately one second of arc, its direction being towards the north-west. This would correspond to a rise of the ground on the south-east.

That is a \u201cquibble\u201d, because the term used by Lamarck (which has been translated as \u201cacquired characters\u201d) is \u201cchangements acquis\u201d, and it is abundantly clear that the change spoken of by Lamarck is a change from the normal characters of a wild species. Such normal characters may be, of course, described as \u201cacquired\u201d when considered in comparison with those of the germ from which an individual develops. But that is not the comparison made by Lamarck or by anyone else who uses his term or the English modification of it, and it is a perversion of fact to pretend that it is. It is the plain fact that the acquired changes indicated by Lamarck are changes as compared with the normal characters of the species. There was no allusion in my letter to the terms \u201cinnate characters\u201d or \u201ccongenital characters\u201d. They, of course (as Dr. Reid says), do not mean the same thing as \u201ccongenital variation\u201d.

U.S. Nat. Mus., vol. xl., p. 490, 1911) he refers to the same species an insect that I captured at light in the Yatiyantota district of Ceylon. In the same paper (p. 505) he describes a new species\u2014Pentazoe peradeniyae\u2014bred by me from the Homopteron\u2014Thompsoniella arcuata\u2014;at Peradeniya.","dc.creator":["GREEN, E.

It is to be expected from the close analogy between the C products of the various radio-active families that actinium C should also show abnormal disintegration, and, further, it might be anticipated that one of the branch products would emit an \u03b1 particle with great velocity and corresponding long range. We have made experiments to test this point. A source of actinium active deposit was covered with a sheet of mica equivalent to about 5 cm. air in stopping power of \u03b1 particles, and the whole placed in an exhausted chamber with a zinc sulphide screen about 2 cm. from the source.

It is to be expected from the close analogy between the C products of the various radio-active families that actinium C should also show abnormal disintegration, and, further, it might be anticipated that one of the branch products would emit an \u03b1 particle with great velocity and corresponding long range. We have made experiments to test this point. A source of actinium active deposit was covered with a sheet of mica equivalent to about 5 cm. air in stopping power of \u03b1 particles, and the whole placed in an exhausted chamber with a zinc sulphide screen about 2 cm. from the source. The numbers of scintillations appearing on the screen per minute for different pressures of the air inside the apparatus were counted, and thus the falling off of the \u03b1 particles with \u201crange\u201d determined.

Trans., May 17, 1917, Dr. P. E.

Beginning with Huxley2, it has been argued that insectivores retain many primitive features and are closer to the ancestral stock of mammals than are other living groups3. Nevertheless, cladistic analysis suggests that living insectivores, at least, are united by derived anatomical features4. Here we analyse DNA sequences from three mitochondrial genes and two nuclear genes to examine relationships of insectivores to other mammals. The representative insectivores are not monophyletic in any of our analyses. Rather, golden moles are included in a clade that contains hyraxes, manatees, elephants, elephant shrews and aardvarks.

Beginning with Huxley2, it has been argued that insectivores retain many primitive features and are closer to the ancestral stock of mammals than are other living groups3. Nevertheless, cladistic analysis suggests that living insectivores, at least, are united by derived anatomical features4. Here we analyse DNA sequences from three mitochondrial genes and two nuclear genes to examine relationships of insectivores to other mammals. The representative insectivores are not monophyletic in any of our analyses. Rather, golden moles are included in a clade that contains hyraxes, manatees, elephants, elephant shrews and aardvarks. Members of this group are of presumed African origin5,6. This implies that there was an extensive African radiation from a single common ancestor that gave rise to ecologically divergent adaptive types. 12S ribosomal RNA transversions suggest that the base of this radiation occurred during Africa's window of isolation in the Cretaceous period before land connections were developed with Europe in the early Cenozoic era.","dc.creator":["Springer, Mark S.","Cleven, Gregory C.","Madsen, Ole","de Jong, Wilfried W.","Waddell, Victor G.","Amrine, Heather M.","Stanhope, Michael J."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=Mammalian phylogeny: shaking the tree.; citation_author=MJ Novacek; citation_volume=356; citation_publication_date=1992; citation_pages=121-125; citation_doi=10.1038/356121a0; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Proc.

These results demonstrate that phot1 and phot2 act redundantly as blue light receptors mediating stomatal opening.","dc.creator":["Kinoshita, Toshinori","Doi, Michio","Suetsugu, Noriyuki","Kagawa, Takatoshi","Wada, Masamitsu","Shimazaki, Ken-ichiro"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Annu.

Using a specific RNA interference approach, the survival of bortezomib-treated melanoma cells was found to rely primarily on Mcl-1, and to a lesser extent on Bcl-xL (but not on Bcl-2). Importantly, neither Mcl-1 nor Bcl-xL inactivation affected the viability of normal melanocytes. This hierarchical requirement of Bcl-2 family members for the maintenance of normal and malignant cells offers a therapeutic window to overcome melanoma chemoresistance in a tumor cell-selective manner.","prism.publicationName":"Cell Death & Differentiation","prism.publicationDate":"2007-06-01","prism.volume":"14","prism.number":"9","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"1605","prism.endingPage":"1616","prism.copyright":"2007 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/4402163","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/sj.cdd.4402163","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/4402163.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/4402163","citation_journal_title":"Cell Death & Differentiation","citation_journal_abbrev":"Cell Death Differ","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-5403","citation_title":"Therapeutic window for melanoma treatment provided by selective effects of the proteasome on Bcl-2 proteins","citation_volume":"14","citation_issue":"9","citation_publication_date":"2007/09","citation_online_date":"2007/06/01","citation_firstpage":"1605","citation_lastpage":"1616","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/sj.cdd.4402163","DOI":"10.1038/sj.cdd.4402163","citation_doi":"10.1038/sj.cdd.4402163","description":"Melanoma cells depend on sustained proteasomal function for survival.

However, Pax5 is not essential for in vitro propagation of pro-B cells in the presence of interleukin-7 and stromal cells. Here we show that pro-B cells lacking Pax5 are also incapable of in vitro B-cell differentiation unless Pax5 expression is restored by retroviral transduction.

However, Pax5 is not essential for in vitro propagation of pro-B cells in the presence of interleukin-7 and stromal cells. Here we show that pro-B cells lacking Pax5 are also incapable of in vitro B-cell differentiation unless Pax5 expression is restored by retroviral transduction.

This study uncovers the cascade by which the SHH signal is relayed from the posterior mesenchyme to the AER and establishes that Formin-dependent activation of the BMP antagonist Gremlin is sufficient to induce Fgf4 and establish the SHH/FGF4 feedback loop.","dc.creator":["Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Aim\u00e9e","Haramis, Anna-Pavlina G.","McMahon, Andrew P.","Zeller, Rolf"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Cell; citation_title=Molecular models for vertebrate limb development.; citation_author=RL Johnson, CJ Tabin; citation_volume=90; citation_publication_date=1997; citation_pages=979-990; citation_doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80364-5; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Cell; citation_title=Sonic hedgehog and Fgf-4 act through a signalling cascade and feedback loop to integrate growth and patterning of the developing limb bud.; citation_author=E Laufer, CE Nelson, RL Johnson, BA Morgan, C Tabin; citation_volume=79; citation_publication_date=1994; citation_pages=993-1003; citation_doi=10.1016/0092-8674(94)90030-2; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=A positive feedback loop coordinates growth and patterning in the vertebrate limb.; citation_author=L Niswander, S Jeffrey, GR Martin, C Tickle; citation_volume=371; citation_publication_date=1994; citation_pages=609-612; citation_doi=10.1038/371609a0; citation_id=CR3","citation_journal_title=Mol.

The calcineurin-mediated translocation is critically dependent on calcium entry through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. GSK-3 can phosphorylate NF-ATc4, promoting its export from the nucleus and antagonizing NF-ATc4-dependent transcription. Furthermore, we show that induction of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 is controlled by the calcium/calcineurin/NF-ATc pathway. This provides a new perspective on the function of calcineurin in the central nervous system and indicates that NF-AT-mediated gene expression may be involved in the induction of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory formation.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"401","prism.number":"6754","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"703","prism.endingPage":"708","prism.copyright":"1999 Macmillan Magazines Ltd.","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/44378","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/44378","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/44378.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/44378","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"L-type calcium channels and GSK-3 regulate the activity of NF-ATc4 in hippocampal neurons","citation_volume":"401","citation_issue":"6754","citation_publication_date":"1999/10","citation_firstpage":"703","citation_lastpage":"708","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/44378","DOI":"10.1038/44378","citation_doi":"10.1038/44378","description":"The molecular basis of learning and memory has been the object of several recent advances, which have focused attention on calcium-regulated pathways controlling transcription.

The calcineurin-mediated translocation is critically dependent on calcium entry through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. GSK-3 can phosphorylate NF-ATc4, promoting its export from the nucleus and antagonizing NF-ATc4-dependent transcription. Furthermore, we show that induction of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 is controlled by the calcium/calcineurin/NF-ATc pathway. This provides a new perspective on the function of calcineurin in the central nervous system and indicates that NF-AT-mediated gene expression may be involved in the induction of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory formation.","dc.creator":["Graef, Isabella A.","Mermelstein, Paul G.","Stankunas, Kryn","Neilson, Joel R.","Deisseroth, Karl","Tsien, Richard W.","Crabtree, Gerald R."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=Involvement of a calcineurin/inhibitor-1 phosphatase cascade in hippocampal long-term depression.; citation_author=null Mulkey, R.

Subsequent platelet aggregation leads to outside-in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 signalling, which results in calcium mobilization4, tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous proteins5,6 including \u03b23 itself7, increased cytoskeletal reorganisation8 and further activation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 (ref. 2). Thus, outside-in signals enhance aggregation, although the mechanisms and functional consequences of specific signalling events remain unclear. Here we describe a mouse that expresses an \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in which the tyrosines in the integrin cytoplasmic tyrosine motif have been mutated to phenylalanines. These mice are selectively impaired in outside-in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 signalling, with defective aggregation and clot-retraction responses in vitro, and an in vivo bleeding defect which is characterized by a pronounced tendency to rebleed. These data provide evidence for an important role of outside-in signalling in platelet physiology.

Subsequent platelet aggregation leads to outside-in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 signalling, which results in calcium mobilization4, tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous proteins5,6 including \u03b23 itself7, increased cytoskeletal reorganisation8 and further activation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 (ref. 2). Thus, outside-in signals enhance aggregation, although the mechanisms and functional consequences of specific signalling events remain unclear. Here we describe a mouse that expresses an \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in which the tyrosines in the integrin cytoplasmic tyrosine motif have been mutated to phenylalanines. These mice are selectively impaired in outside-in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 signalling, with defective aggregation and clot-retraction responses in vitro, and an in vivo bleeding defect which is characterized by a pronounced tendency to rebleed. These data provide evidence for an important role of outside-in signalling in platelet physiology. Furthermore, they identify the integrin cytoplasmic tyrosine motif as a key mediator of \u03b2-integrin signals and a potential target for new therapeutic agents.","dc.creator":["Law, Debbie A.","DeGuzman, Francis R.","Heiser, Patrick","Ministri-Madrid, Kathleen","Killeen, Nigel","Phillips, David R."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Cell; citation_title=Integrins: versatility, modulation, and signaling in cell adhesion.; citation_author=RO Hynes; citation_volume=69; citation_publication_date=1992; citation_pages=11-25; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Blood; citation_title=Integrin signaling: the platelet paradigm.; citation_author=S Shattil, H Kashiwagi, N Pampori; citation_volume=91; citation_publication_date=1998; citation_pages=1-14; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Cell; citation_title=GPIIb-IIIa: the responsive integrin.; citation_author=DR Phillips, IF Charo, RM Scarborough; citation_volume=65; citation_publication_date=1991; citation_pages=359-362; citation_id=CR3","citation_journal_title=Am.

They also give rise to various groups of RNAs that can regulate gene expression. Short RNAs that form from enhancer sequences might be one such class of regulatory RNA. Regulatory proteins bind non-coding DNA either close to a gene's mRNA transcription start site at a promoter, or further away on the genome at an enhancer. Enhancers act by helping to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter.

They also give rise to various groups of RNAs that can regulate gene expression. Short RNAs that form from enhancer sequences might be one such class of regulatory RNA. Regulatory proteins bind non-coding DNA either close to a gene's mRNA transcription start site at a promoter, or further away on the genome at an enhancer. Enhancers act by helping to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter.

However, its potential is limited by the technical challenge of achieving significant pulse stretching (that is, high temporal dispersion) and low optical loss, which are the critical factors influencing imaging quality, in the visible spectrum demanded in many of these applications. We present a new pulse-stretching technique, termed free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay (FACED), with three distinguishing features absent in the prevailing dispersive-fiber-based implementations: (1) it generates substantial, reconfigurable temporal dispersion in free space (>1\u2009ns\u2009nm\u22121) with low intrinsic loss (<6\u2009dB) at visible wavelengths; (2) its wavelength-invariant pulse-stretching operation introduces a new paradigm in time-stretch imaging, which can now be implemented both with and without spectral encoding; and (3) pulse stretching in FACED inherently provides an ultrafast all-optical laser-beam scanning mechanism at a line-scan rate of tens of MHz. Using FACED, we demonstrate not only ultrafast laser-scanning time-stretch imaging with superior bright-field image quality compared with previous work but also, for the first time, MHz fluorescence and colorized time-stretch microscopy. Our results show that this technique could enable a wider scope of applications in high-speed and high-throughput biological microscopy that were once out of reach. A new pulse-stretching technique has enabled ultrafast laser-scanning time-stretch imaging to be achieved in the important visible region. Optical time-stretching is used to realize real-time continuous imaging at ultrahigh frame rates, but current technologies based on dispersive fibers are generally restricted to near-infrared wavelengths. Now, a team at the University of Hong Kong led by Kevin Tsia has overcome this limitation by developing a pulse-stretching technique that they dub free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay. It has the advantages of generating a large dispersion in free space with low loss and of enabling wavelength-invariant stretching. The researchers demonstrated its potential by realizing ultrafast laser-scanning time-stretch imaging with excellent bright-field image quality.

In this review, we perform a systematic and comparative study of these two flat panel display technologies. First, we review recent advances in LCDs and OLEDs, including material development, device configuration and system integration. Next we analyze and compare their performances by six key display metrics: response time, contrast ratio, color gamut, lifetime, power efficiency, and panel flexibility. In this section, we focus on two key parameters: motion picture response time (MPRT) and ambient contrast ratio (ACR), which dramatically affect image quality in practical application scenarios. MPRT determines the image blur of a moving picture, and ACR governs the perceived image contrast under ambient lighting conditions. It is intriguing that LCD can achieve comparable or even slightly better MPRT and ACR than OLED, although its response time and contrast ratio are generally perceived to be much inferior to those of OLED. Finally, three future trends are highlighted, including high dynamic range, virtual reality/augmented reality and smart displays with versatile functions. The two leading flat-panel display technologies\u2014liquid crystal displays and organic light-emitting diode displays\u2014have been compared. Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) currently have the upper hand, but organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology is rapidly catching up. Shin-Tson Wu of the University of Central Florida and colleagues have documented recent material and design advances in these two technologies and analyzed display performance with respect to six key metrics: response time, contrast ratio, color gamut, lifetime, power efficiency, and panel flexibility. They concluded that LCDs are superior in terms of cost, lifetime and brightness, whereas OLED displays offer better black states, flexibility, and faster response times. The technologies have similar ambient contrast ratio, image motion blur, color gamut, viewing angle and power consumption.

The aim of the study was to explore the possibility of assessing the response to a bronchodilator from the change in Ars. FOT measurements were performed at 12 Hz in 36 young children before and after salbutamol. Transrespiratory pressure was varied in two ways: directly at the mouth (standard generator, SG) and around the head (head generator, HG), a variant nearly free of upper airway artifact. Salbutamol induced significantly lower Rrs and Zrs change with SG than HG (respectively, p = 0.0003 and 0.05). The relative change in Ars was not significantly different with SG and HG. Both estimates were significantly correlated (p < 0.0001).
