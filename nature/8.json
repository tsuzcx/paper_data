Though foremost in many things, Britain is far behind Continental countries in the field of physiological science. We can boast of a few distinguished physiologists, as John Hunter, Sir Charles Bell, and Dr. John Reid; and famous microscopists, as Carpenter and Beale; but a very small number of English names can be cited compared with the host of Continental physiologists, past and present, as Magendie, M\u00fcller, Von Beyold, Von Baer, B\u00e9clard, Bernard, Brown-Sequard, Du Bois Reymond, Helmholtz, &c. This discrepancy arises not from want of talent, but from lack of opportunity. The mental qualities required by a physiologist, as observation and memory, are developed separately at different periods of life. Hence there are only a limited number of years during which any such branch of learning can be cultivated with fresh ardour, and during which the power termed originality can be brought into play. The Continental schools make use of these precious years by affording those who are naturally inclined to cultivate any one branch of science, full scope for repeating the observations of their predecessors, and for endeavouring to add to the existing stock of knowledge. By having various laboratories and certain paid appointments connected with their universities, they allow young men to devote their whole time and energy to the study of individual subjects, as physiology. Those who set themselves to work of this kind do not look forward to the practice of the medical profession, but purpose to live and work as physiologists. These young men are known by their labours to be specialists, and are proposed by the senatus with which they are connected for a vacant professorship when it occurs. This is the only method of securing original and extensive work in any one scientific branch, as Physiology. It would be well, therefore, if the approaching Royal Commission of Inquiry into the State of Science in this country would not overlook Physiology, but would make some arrangements whereby Great Britain might no longer be stigmatised by her Continental neighbours as \u201chaving no Physiologist.\u201d","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"2","prism.number":"47","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"413","prism.endingPage":"414","prism.copyright":"1870 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/002413a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/002413a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/002413a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/002413a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"English Physiology","citation_volume":"2","citation_issue":"47","citation_publication_date":"1870/09","citation_firstpage":"413","citation_lastpage":"414","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/002413a0","DOI":"10.1038/002413a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/002413a0","description":"THE present state of physiology in this country ought to be a matter of regret.

According to Darwinian principles, there is what is called correlation of growth, by which I believe is meant, that an organ, or some part of the organism, is selected, not because itself is useful, but because its growth is somehow correlated to some other organ which is useful. Now, as a growth is admitted which exists by virtue of its correlation to some useful organ, why should not an atrophy of some part of the organism also be admitted as correlated to some organ which has been naturally selected on account of its usefulness? Although the nudity of the back of man is not in itself useful, nevertheless the atrophy of the hair on his back may be correlated to the development of some organ peculiar to man, and which is useful to him; or, in other words, the growth of the hair on the human back, although in itself useful, is incompatible with the growth of some other organ which may be infinitely more useful to him. Such atrophy, for all we know to the contrary, may be in some way correlated to cerebral development, to the erect posture, to the development of the hand, to the organs of speech, &c. At all events, if we cannot positively state that our dorsal nudity is so correlated, we certainly cannot say that it is not. I do not think that Mr. Wallace is justified in excluding the nudity of the back of man from the theory of natural selection, because he cannot show that it is useful. It may not in itself be useful, but it may be subordinate to some organ which is most useful. I consider that if the principles of a correlated atrophy be admitted, the stumblingblock of our bare backs will cease to trouble Darwinian thinkers. The argument struck me when I first read Mr. Wallace's remarkable \u201cContributions to Natural Selection,\u201d but as I now see, by his article in p. 9, No. 53, Vol. III. of NATURE, that his difficulty has not been answered, I venture to address the foregoing to you, with the hope that my argument may be Of some utility.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"3","prism.number":"59","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"127","prism.endingPage":"127","prism.copyright":"1870 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003127c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/003127c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003127c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003127c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Man's Bare Back","citation_volume":"3","citation_issue":"59","citation_publication_date":"1870/12","citation_firstpage":"127","citation_lastpage":"127","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/003127c0","DOI":"10.1038/003127c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/003127c0","description":"WILL you be good enough to favour me with a small space in your excellent journal for these few lines, in answer to Mr Wallace's difficulty with regard to the nudity of the back of man.

Granted that the mean temperature of the summer months, June to September, is 0\u00b0.9 higher at Greenwich than at the eight other stations referred to, it does not follow that this alone is the cause of the higher average temperature at the former place.

Considerable stress is laid upon their influence in dissipating malaria; but I have not found this to be the case in Queensland, one of the head-quarters of the tree. I have personally suffered from malaria in the very heart of a forest extending for many miles in every direction, and composed mainly of all the varieties of Eucalyptus, and not by any means remarkable for the extent of swampy ground, and have known many instances of febrile attacks among shepherds and stockmen in the locality. Moreover I was told on inquiry that these attacks were not confined to any particular year, but that every year some cases might be expected. I was greatly surprised at reading in your \u201cNotes\u201d (NATURE, vol. xvi. p. 557) that the mosquitoes had disappeared with the introduction of the \u201cgum\u201d trees into Algeria. This would not be the experience of any one who has lived in Australia, I believe. I have found these pests so intolerable on high land, where almost the only tree to be found was one variety or other of Eucalyptus, and sometimes all, that sleep was impossible while camping out at night, and life a burden in the day by reason of these pests. The gums emit a most decided odour, especially in strong sunlight. When riding across the great Queensland plains and approaching wooded spurs I have (Scottic\u00e9) \u201cfelt\u201d the characteristic smell of the gums at a considerable distance. These plains\u2014ten miles in breadth\u2014are not crossed in a short time, and the resinous odour of the gums, omnipresent in the forest and scarcely noticed there, strikes one forcibly when approaching the trees after the olfactory organs have been for some time deprived of it. Whether this odour has any effect or whether it is the preservative against malaria, I do not know. The growth of these trees in South America is very rapid. When in the Banda Oriental some years ago I examined a plantation of red and blue gums, then eight years old. The trees were at least forty feet high, and many of them measured thirty-six inches in circumference at three feet from the ground. They had a profusion of foliage such as I have never seen on the same trees in Australia. This was right out on \u201cpampa\u201d land, in deep alluvial soil. These trees had fought their way up, in spite of the black ants so destructive to foliage\u2014the owner told me that they had at first stripped the young trees\u2014and the tremendous gales which sweep over this open country. Those to the westward and south-westward of the plantation were far inferior in size to those on the east and north. This was the only grove of Eucalypti in the Banda, and it demonstrates the possibility of covering the naked pampas to any extent with forest. English settlers in the River Plate countries should note this fact, and I am sure the enlightened owner of the Estancia \u201cSherenden\u201d would supply any of his country men with seed.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"17","prism.number":"418","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"10","prism.endingPage":"10","prism.copyright":"1877 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/017010b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/017010b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/017010b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/017010b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Eucalyptus","citation_volume":"17","citation_issue":"418","citation_publication_date":"1877/11","citation_firstpage":"10","citation_lastpage":"10","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/017010b0","DOI":"10.1038/017010b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/017010b0","description":"THESE trees are now attracting so much attention that even the small amount of experience I may be able to offer may not be unacceptable to your readers.

No. I. At Poplar. Pipe laid on second floor, between flooring-boards above and ceiling below, between joists the usual distance apart; plenty of room all round pipes to obtain access to any part of the floor, also rat-holes in woodwork to facilitate communication. As the pipe lay above the ceiling of the floor below, there was no necessity to attack the pipe in order to get through the ceiling\u2014if that were desired. A hole could easily have been made at any point on either side of the pipe. The upper floor was a corn loft, and it is inferred from the circumstances, that the rats, feeding upon this very dry food, had tapped the water-pipe to obtain a supply of water close at hand. No. II. On Haverstock Hill. Cistern in scullery about six feet from the floor, pipe (lead), comes thence down wall, passes under floor of scullery to kitchen to supply kitchen boiler. Pipe laid on the earth, between joists, raised, of course, on bricks. Pipe gnawed on upper side. Plenty of room all round for rats to pass freely under all parts of the floor, as any practical builder will readily understand.

It may therefore be interesting to you and to Mr. Wallace to learn of some striking exceptions to this rule in the case of Australian plants which have been introduced on the Nilgiri plateau in Southern India, at elevations ranging from about 5500 to nearly 8000 feet above sea-level. Acacias and Eucalypti in particular have found a congenial home in this region, and visitors from Australia who have seen them say that they appear even more vigorous than in their native soil. Hundreds of acres of Eucalyptus Globulus and of Acacia melanoxylon and A. dealbata have been planted by Government as firewood reserves, and the trees have grown up splendidly. The only drawback to the success of the experiment has been that the Acacia melanoxylon has been greatly injured by Loranthaceous parasites. In fact this species will apparently in course of time be exterminated by these indigenous pests. Besides Eucalyptus Globulus the following species of the genus have also been introduced, and thrive well:\u2014E. sideroxylon, E. obliqua, E. fissilis, E. rostrata, E. viminalis, E. amygdalina, and E. perfoliata. In addition to the two species of Acacia already mentioned, the following have also been added to the list of healthy growing exotics on the Nilgiris, viz. A. pycnantha, A. salicina, A. longifolia, A. decurrens, A. cultnformis, A. elata, and other, might also be enumerated. As regards other Australian plants on these hills we have Hakea, Banksia, Myoporum, Kunzea, Tristania, Pittosporum, Beaufortia, &c. In short there is a very considerable Australian flora flourishing on the \u201cBlue Mountains\u201d of Madras, and so extensively have the trees been planted out about the principal stations that they have given quite a new character to the scenery. Some of the acacias have a considerable resemblance in shape and colour to the Scotch fir, and this likeness has, to some visitors, added a fresh charm to the beauties of the scenery.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"23","prism.number":"598","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"555","prism.endingPage":"555","prism.copyright":"1881 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/023555a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/023555a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/023555a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/023555a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Australian Plants in India","citation_volume":"23","citation_issue":"598","citation_publication_date":"1881/04","citation_firstpage":"555","citation_lastpage":"555","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/023555a0","DOI":"10.1038/023555a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/023555a0","description":"IN NATURE, vol. xxiii. p. 370, some remarks are made (with reference to Mr. Wallace's observations in \u201cIsland Life\u201d) regarding the apparent inability of Australian plants to become naturalised in the northern hemisphere.

Some of the acacias have a considerable resemblance in shape and colour to the Scotch fir, and this likeness has, to some visitors, added a fresh charm to the beauties of the scenery.","dc.creator":["BIDIE, G."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["BIDIE, G."],"citation_author_institution":["Madras"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Australian Plants in India","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Australian Plants in India&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"023577b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Lesquereux that a large number of magnolia leaves, from the Tertiary of Alaska, show serpentine trails not larger than a thread, running all over the leaves, apparently under the epithelium,\u201d and Dr. Hagen evidently believes them to be the mines or burrows of some Tineid larv\u00e6. Precisely such mines are now made in this country, in the leaves of magnolias, by a larva of the genus Phyllocnistis, Zell. The moth has not been bred from the larv\u00e6, but the mine and larv\u00e6 are indistinguishable from those made by Phyllocnislis liriodendronella, Clem., in leaves of Liriodendron tulipifera, and doubtless it is the same species in both of these allied trees. \u201cWhat is a species?\u201d however, is a doubtful question in Phyllocnistis, at least in our American species. No species of this or any other genus is known to burrow in the leaves of any of the other genera of plants named in Dr. Hagen's letter besides Magnolia, Liquidambar, and Sassifras. Another Phyllocnistis mines the leaves of Liquidambar, and has been described by me under the name of P. liquidambar-isella, but it is probably identical with P. vitifoliella, Cham. The mine is similar to, but distinct from, that of P. liricdendronella. The larva which mines Sassafras leaves is that of Gracilaria sassafracella, Cham., but it leaves the mine at a very early stage of larval life, when the mine is too small to be recognised in a fossil leaf, unless it has been unusually well preserved. In this connection I will add that I distinctly remember having somewhere seen a figure, by Lesquereux I think, of a fossil leaf of a species of Acer, on which there were several blotches, one of which bore a strong resemblance to the mine of Lithocolletis aceriella, now made in leaves of Acer saccharinum; but as I saw only the figure, and not the fossil, I cannot be certain that it was a mine of that larva.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"25","prism.number":"649","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"529","prism.endingPage":"529","prism.copyright":"1882 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/025529c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/025529c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/025529c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/025529c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Burrowing Larv\u00e6","citation_volume":"25","citation_issue":"649","citation_publication_date":"1882/04","citation_firstpage":"529","citation_lastpage":"529","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/025529c0","DOI":"10.1038/025529c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/025529c0","description":"IN his letter ante p. 265, Dr. Hagen states that he had \u201cbeen informed by M.

I was then at San Fernando, and could perceive almost every evening the rosy and blue or black and white rays converging to a point apparently below the horizon. I was able to trace the rays from west to east many times, and frequently also to trace the black or blue spaces to visible prominences in the cumuli in the western horizon, to whose shadows there is no doubt the rays were due, as they swept the sky with such a rapidity; and they were so persistently traceable to the bright bordered cumuli, that even though there were any hills in the direction of the setting sun (which there were not), the phenomenon could not be attributed to them. Besides, I have observed it when off the coast of Portugal, which leaves the hill shadows out of the question, as the observations were made in the (two consecutive) evenings.

I was then at San Fernando, and could perceive almost every evening the rosy and blue or black and white rays converging to a point apparently below the horizon. I was able to trace the rays from west to east many times, and frequently also to trace the black or blue spaces to visible prominences in the cumuli in the western horizon, to whose shadows there is no doubt the rays were due, as they swept the sky with such a rapidity; and they were so persistently traceable to the bright bordered cumuli, that even though there were any hills in the direction of the setting sun (which there were not), the phenomenon could not be attributed to them. Besides, I have observed it when off the coast of Portugal, which leaves the hill shadows out of the question, as the observations were made in the (two consecutive) evenings. Though the sky is too cloudy in this part of Spain, by looking at the right place at the right time I have been able to see it many times.

Almost every conceivable reason has had its advocates for the fact that some men persistently turn to the left, and others to the right, when walking without the aid of sight. I am familiar with some ambidextrous men, and about the same number of left-handed men, but I cannot recall a single instance of a left-legged man, and think they must be somewhat rare. In the present question it might, perhaps, be well to put aside peculiarities of the arms\u2014as occupation and education enter very largely into the method of their use\u2014and confine observations to the legs alone. Mr. Larden has, I think, very nearly arrived at the solution of the problem with his definition of right or left strong-legged men circling to the right or left respectively. I take exception, however, to his referring the peculiarity to the strength of the limb, and think the following suggestion may afford help in the matter, being founded upon observations, and providing a reason for circling in walking in either right- or left-legged men:\u2014It has been frequently remarked of late years that short-leggedness on one side or the other is of common occurrence\u2014the cause is doubtless attributable to a retardation in the growth of the limb caused by one or more of the many illnesses to which we are subject in the earlier years of our life. Excepting when the retardation in the growth of the limb is considerable, it produces no inconvenience, and the possessor of a limb shorter than its fellow by some tenths of an inch may never be aware of the deficiency. To apply this fact to the question (it is another matter why the left leg is more frequently the short one), Mr. Larden's strong leg should correspond to my long leg. The long leg makes a longer step in proportion to the difference in its length over its fellow. If the right be the longer leg, as is oftener the case, the walker will circle to the left, and vice vers\u00e2. In my experiments I fixed a drawing-pin into the sole of each boot, selected a hard, level, untrodden piece of sand on the seashore, about 250 yards in length, and used a measuring-tape which would take ten or twenty paces in one measurement for obtaining the difference in length of the paces; the drawing-pins afford a definite and precise mark in the sand. To insure a good and regular start I always allowed my man a few yards start with his eyes open and fixed on the distant mark. He then, without stopping, put over his head and face a cardboard cylinder open at the top. This allows the eyes to be open, whilst effectually preventing any lateral vision. I think this, small detail as it is, important, as a bandage tied round the head across the eyes is sometimes unpleasant and often confusing.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"29","prism.number":"743","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"286","prism.endingPage":"287","prism.copyright":"1884 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029286d0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/029286d0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029286d0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029286d0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Unconscious Bias in Walking","citation_volume":"29","citation_issue":"743","citation_publication_date":"1884/01","citation_firstpage":"286","citation_lastpage":"287","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/029286d0","DOI":"10.1038/029286d0","citation_doi":"10.1038/029286d0","description":"THE question whether a man will walk to the right or left in a mist, in darkness, or if blindfolded, has led to no little controversy and dispute.

I think this, small detail as it is, important, as a bandage tied round the head across the eyes is sometimes unpleasant and often confusing.","dc.creator":["HAWKSLEY, THOS."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["HAWKSLEY, THOS."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Unconscious Bias in Walking","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Unconscious Bias in Walking&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"029382b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In too many cases he passes through the first, second, and third forms of a school, learning little more than the habit of diligent plodding, and developing little more than the art of storing away an unheardof quantity of dry facts. He learns, for instance, page after page of grammar rules; he learns rules for making numerical transformations; he even learns in the same fashion answers to questions that examiners are known to set for the purpose of finding out whether the pupil has been intelligently taught!

That \u201c the size of the leaf . . . is regulated mainly with reference to the thickness of the stem \u201d seems somewhat self-evident, as a large leaf must have a large stem to carry it, as, e.g., may be seen by comparing the slender shoot of a Dcodar with a cabbage-stalk ; but he adds: \u201c The size once determined exercises much influence on the form.\u201d This is a deduction which seems to require verification. Sir John gives the area of a beech-leaf as about 3 square inches, but the form remains the same whatever the size. Size rather depends on vigorous growth, as in the following instances: Populus alba leaves on a vigorous basal shoot were 61/2 \u00d7 31/2 inches, the diameter of the shoot being 1/8inch; on the upper branches of the same tree many leaves were only 11/2 to 21/2 inches long, the diameter of the shoot being also inch. Similarly growing oak leaves of the same shape were 6 \u00d73 inches and 2\u00d73/4 inches respectively. An Ancuba japonica bore rounded leaves on a basal shoot 4 \u00d7 31/4 inches, but those on the stem were 4 \u00d71 inch. In this case, as in other plants with (normally) dimorphic leaves, as ivy, it is difficult to see what connection there is between size and form. Indeed leaves of every degree of superficial area can be found amongst the lobed ones on the climbing stem of ivy, and the entire ones of the flowering branch. Sir John adds that \u201cthe form of the inner edge [of the beech] . . . decides that of the outer one.\u201d He does not seem to have verified this deduction. The two edges are symmetrical in this leaf, but they are not so in the elm and lime. How will the inner edge explain the cause of their obliquity? If, however, the buds of the lime be examined, a more probable cause (as it seems to me) will be discovered in the conditions of development. He describes the Eucalyptus, when young, as having \u201chorizontal leaves, which in older ones are replaced by scimitar-shaped phyllodes.\u201d Bentham and Hooker say of Eucalyptus: \u201cFolia in arbore juniore s\u00e6pe opposita, in adulto pleraque alterna,\u201d but makes no mention of phyllodes. Speaking of evergreen leaves, he says: \u201cGlossy leaves have a tendency to throw [snow] off, and thus escape, hence evergreen leaves are very generally smooth and glossy.\u201d This sentence appears to imply that such leaves are glossy in anticipation of snow! a deduction which certainly requires verification. Again: \u201cEvergreen leaves often have special protection ... by thorns and spines. Of this the holly is a familiar illustration; and it was pointed out that in old plants above the range of browsing quadrupeds, the leaves tend to lose their spines and become unarmed.\u201d The inference the reader draws from this is that when the holly grows out of reach of browsing animals it has no necessity to produce prickly leaves, and so changes them accordingly, thereby implying that unarmed leaves were in some way preferable. This is another instance of deductive reasoning which requires verification, for it seems to be attributing to the holly a very unexpected process of ratiocination! But it is not at all usual for hollies to do this. I have several from six to nearly twenty feet high, and not one has borne an unarmed leaf. Though my cows do not touch a holly hedge, yet one young bush lately planted has taken their fancy, and they have bitten it all to pieces.

The height of the high-lying plateau of the Canton Grisons, more especially in the Engadine, and the remarkable absence of aqueous vapour, causes many more stars to be visible here than in the denser air of England, and this, no doubt, in large measure, accounts for the superior brilliancy of the display as witnessed here.

The grounds of our own confidence in them are (1) that the conditions were in many cases such as completely to exclude unconscious physical signs, and (2) that, if the success was due to fraud, it was not fraud which the investigators failed to detect, but fraud in which they must actively have shared. But, where the scientific presumption against new phenomena is so strong, it is best to recognise that no line can be drawn at which the evidence for them ought to be found convincing, and that, till it actually is found convincing, it is incomplete.

In the earlier days of the goldfields there was among the diggers much speculation, of a scientific and semi-scientific nature, as to the processes by which Nature had produced the accumulations of coarse and fine gold dust which it was their business to extract from the alluvial drifts. The most obvious explanation, of course, was that the grains of gold had an origin similar to that of the d\u00e9bris and detritus of various characters which made up the alluvium itself; and this explanation seemed to harmonize so completely with the general processes of Nature that at one time it was almost universally accepted as the correct one.

The only scheme at present in the field is that put forward by the Councils of University and King's Colleges in the proposed charter for an Albert University. This scheme has never met with the cordial support of a large section at least of the teaching staff of University College, and for the very obvious reason that it does not constitute a professorial University, but creates a new examining body on which the two Colleges will be, in the beginning at any rate, largely represented. The Albert University charter would create a second Victoria University in London. Now, both Mr. Dyer and Prof. Lankester are agreed that we do not want a federal University like Victoria in London ; but they seem to forget that this pettifogging excuse for a University\u2014a scheme drafted by bureaucratic rather than academic minds\u2014is the only scheme in the field, and that, further, the Lord President of the Council has determined to hear by counsel, on an early day in June, what can be said for and against this scheme. It is further rumoured that the Burlington House Senate intends, after its recent discomfiture, to remain absolutely neutral. The danger, then, that we shall have a repetition in London of the difficulties of Manchester is a very immediate one. Let me point out exactly the anomalies of the Albert scheme. In the first place, it does not create a teaching University, but a new examining body. The University as such will have no control over the appointment of the professoriate either at University or King's Colleges, it will have no funds to dispose of and there will be nothing to prevent rival second-rate teachers and teaching equipment instead of first-rate central teaching and central laboratories. For example, at the present time, putting aside the Central Institute, we have some half-dozen second-rate physical laboratories in London, but not a really first-class one worthy of a modern University among them. So long as there is competition between the Colleges, so long as they possess a double staff competing at every turn with each other for students' fees, this is unlikely to be remedied. Prof. Lankester speaks of a union of King's and University, and talks about their combined resources. The fusion of these two Colleges would certainly be the first stage to a true professorial University in London, but there is nothing in the Albert charter to bring this about: it unites the two Colleges not for teaching but for examining purposes. But what is still worse, while these two Colleges will remain autonomous, the Albert charter proposes to admit any further autonomous bodies, the teaching of which can be shown to have reached a certain academic standard. These bodies will not be absorbed, but their independent staffs will be represented on the Faculties and Senate. Here we have in fact the University of London over again,\u2014at first composed almost entirely of the two Colleges, afterwards embracing all sorts and conditions of institutions in London, and ultimately open to every isolated text-book reader in the universe. It cannot be therefore too strongly insisted upon that the Albert charter, if granted, will not call into existence a professorial University, but federate a group, and an ever-widening group, of competing institutions for the purposes of examination. If it sheds for a time any additional lustre on the teaching staffs of the two Colleges\u2014which I am much inclined to doubt\u2014it will not achieve, what most of us have at heart, the establishment in London, at any rate in the germ, of a great University in the Scottish or German sense. A University, on the scale we hope for, would absorb the plant of University and King's Colleges, of the Royal College of Science, and of the Central Institute without the least difficulty. With the death or transference of existing teachers, whose pecuniary interests would have of course to be carefully safeguarded, special branches of higher teaching and research might be localized at these various centres,1 and we thus might reach in the future an efficient University organization in London. This may indeed be considered a merely ideal future, but any scheme like the proposed Albert University, which will only impede its ultimate realization, ought to meet with strenuous opposition from those who believe that a great professorial University must sooner or later be established in London.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"44","prism.number":"1127","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"102","prism.endingPage":"104","prism.copyright":"1891 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/044102e0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/044102e0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/044102e0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/044102e0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The University of London","citation_volume":"44","citation_issue":"1127","citation_publication_date":"1891/06","citation_firstpage":"102","citation_lastpage":"104","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/044102e0","DOI":"10.1038/044102e0","citation_doi":"10.1038/044102e0","description":"I DO not wish to criticize in the least Prof. Lankester's valuable statement in your last issue, with which I entirely agree; but I desire to point out that unless some energetic action is taken very soon we are likely to be farther than ever from the ideal which he has in view\u2014namely, the establishment of a strong professorial University in London.

I write now rather to support Mr. Hopkins in his strictures than to offer any fresh criticisms of my own. The articles on \u201cInsect Colours\u201d published in these columns are, as the author states, to be regarded in the light of an abstract of a series of more extended papers published in the Entomologist. The papers in the latter publication from their title led us to suppose that Mr. Coste had made some contribution to our knowledge of the chemistry of insect pigments. I read them from month to month in the hope of getting new light on this subject, which is of such general interest to both chemists and biologists: I regret to say that I have been grievously disappointed. The experiments thus far described amount simply to the fact\u2014not altogether astonishing\u2014that strong chemical reagents modify the colours of Lepidopterous pigments or in some cases dissolve them out of the wings. The bearing of these observations on the chemistry of the pigments is so remote as to be practically useless until we know something of the chemical nature of these pigments. The methods adopted by Mr. Coste are not likely to advance our knowledge in this direction very much, and it is certainly remarkable that in treating of yellows he makes no reference1 to the only real contribution to the chemistry of Lepidopterous pigments, viz. the experiments made by Mr. Hopkins, and published in the Proceedings of the Chemical Society in 1889. Mr. Coste is no doubt acquainted with those South American Papilios with a large red spot on the hind wing, which spot loses its red colour and becomes of a brilliant metallic bluish green when the wing is tilted so that the incident and reflected rays form a very wide angle. The colour is in this case doubtless a mixed result, partly due to pigment and partly to interference. Now, anyone who has observed this and other similar colour phenomena in insects might describe his observations as contributions to the physics of insect colours. If he thought proper to adopt this course, he would be misleading physicists. The observation of the bare facts is as much a contribution to the physics of insect colours as the statement that a rainbow can be seen in the sky is a contribution to the physics of illuminated water-drops. It seems to me that Mr. Coste's experiments bear the same relationship to the chemistry of insect colours that the mere observation of interference colours in insects bears to the physics of insect colours.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"45","prism.number":"1174","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"605","prism.endingPage":"606","prism.copyright":"1892 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/045605f0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/045605f0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/045605f0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/045605f0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Pigments of Lepidoptera","citation_volume":"45","citation_issue":"1174","citation_publication_date":"1892/04","citation_firstpage":"605","citation_lastpage":"606","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/045605f0","DOI":"10.1038/045605f0","citation_doi":"10.1038/045605f0","description":"I WAS about to pen some remarks on Mr. Perry Coste's recent articles on this subject, when a letter from Mr. Gowland Hopkins in the last number of NATURE (p. 581) expressed substantially the same views as those which I had arrived at.

The following observations bearing on this question may be of sufficient interest to justify publication. They refer to a species of lizard of the genus Stellio (identified in Tristram's \u201cFauna and Flora of Palestine\u201d as S. cordylina), which is extremely common in these parts. When one of these lizards is captured, it makes a few vigorous efforts to escape, and then, if held firmly, falls into a limp, motionless state, which might easily lead an, inexperienced person to think it dead. A very little examination, however, shows that the animal is not dead, but in a trance-like condition.

The following observations bearing on this question may be of sufficient interest to justify publication. They refer to a species of lizard of the genus Stellio (identified in Tristram's \u201cFauna and Flora of Palestine\u201d as S. cordylina), which is extremely common in these parts. When one of these lizards is captured, it makes a few vigorous efforts to escape, and then, if held firmly, falls into a limp, motionless state, which might easily lead an, inexperienced person to think it dead. A very little examination, however, shows that the animal is not dead, but in a trance-like condition. Gentle respiratory movements are visible just behind the shoulders, and sometimes show a rising and falling rhythm with short intervals of complete rest; the eyes may remain wide open, but are commonly half-closed, and the lids wink slowly from time to time spontaneously or by reflex action; the mouth is almost always open\u2014sometimes wide, sometimes but little\u2014and in either case the jaw is quite rigid, and if closed by force is apt to reopen when the pressure is withdrawn; the limbs lie extended and semi-flaccid, with some approach to a cataleptic condition, i.e. if bent, or stretched into positions not too strained, they maintain such positions when let go; and the same is true of the trunk and tail.

Nearly all earthquakes are accompanied by a rumbling sound, due, I believe, to the small and rapid vibrations proceeding chiefly from the margins of the area over which the fault-slip producing the earthquake takes place (Geol. Mag., vol. ix., 1892, pp. 208\u2013218). In some districts (Comrie in Perthshire, East Haddan, in Connecticut, Pignerol in Piedmont, Meleda in the Adriatic, &c.), sounds without shocks are common during intervals which may last for several years, but slight shocks with sound occasionally intervene, as if the sounds and shocks were manifestations, differing only in degree and the method in which we perceive them, of one and the same phenomenon. In great earthquakes, the sound-area is confined to the neighbourhood of the epicentre; in moderate and slight shocks the sound-area and disturbed area approximately coincide, or the sound-area may even overlap the disturbed area. In the limiting case, the disturbed area vanishes, and the vibrations are perceptible only as sound.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"53","prism.number":"1358","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"4","prism.endingPage":"4","prism.copyright":"1895 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/053004d0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/053004d0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/053004d0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/053004d0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Curious Aerial or Subterranean Sounds","citation_volume":"53","citation_issue":"1358","citation_publication_date":"1895/11","citation_firstpage":"4","citation_lastpage":"4","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/053004d0","DOI":"10.1038/053004d0","citation_doi":"10.1038/053004d0","description":"Is it not possible that the \u201cBeris\u00e0l Guns\u201d and \u201cmist pouffers,\u201d referred to by Prof. Darwin (p. 650), are merely earthquake sounds, the attendant shock being too slight to be otherwise perceptible? Nearly all earthquakes are accompanied by a rumbling sound, due, I believe, to the small and rapid vibrations proceeding chiefly from the margins of the area over which the fault-slip producing the earthquake takes place (Geol. Mag., vol. ix., 1892, pp. 208\u2013218).

Bergeat, Habilitationschrift, M\u00fcnchen, 1896), have agreed in describing the volcano as being explosively active, there may some interest attach to a statement of the present condition of affairs, as seen by Prof. H. F. Reid, of Johns Hopkins University, and the writer, on October 27 and 28 of the present year. The westernmost of the four small craters described by Bergeat was not observed at all, the next two were discharging rather copious volumes of vapour, and the easternmost, or \u201cold,\u201d crater was giving out a very little steam from its bottom. The most steam was issuing from cracks in the eastern rim of the \u201cold\u201d crater, especially from one at the north-eastern or seaward corner of the rim. Much steam was issuing from the southern rim overhanging the second and third craters, and the ridge leading from it to the main mountain mass. Nothing in the nature of an eruption was taking place, and it was evident that the craters had been in this condition for some time.

Bergeat, Habilitationschrift, M\u00fcnchen, 1896), have agreed in describing the volcano as being explosively active, there may some interest attach to a statement of the present condition of affairs, as seen by Prof. H. F. Reid, of Johns Hopkins University, and the writer, on October 27 and 28 of the present year. The westernmost of the four small craters described by Bergeat was not observed at all, the next two were discharging rather copious volumes of vapour, and the easternmost, or \u201cold,\u201d crater was giving out a very little steam from its bottom. The most steam was issuing from cracks in the eastern rim of the \u201cold\u201d crater, especially from one at the north-eastern or seaward corner of the rim. Much steam was issuing from the southern rim overhanging the second and third craters, and the ridge leading from it to the main mountain mass. Nothing in the nature of an eruption was taking place, and it was evident that the craters had been in this condition for some time. Later inquiry at Lipari elicited the information from Bartolo Nicotera, the guide, that there had been no eruption on Stromboli for about a year. The high ridge over the crater, known as the Cima, showed steam issuing from along its summit, more than 200 metres above the crater.","dc.creator":["HOVEY, E.

It traversed a path of about 20 or 25 degrees, during which it fell about 5 degrees. The radiant of the meteor was probably in Auriga, Perseus, or Aries, so that it belonged to a different system from that which furnished the brilliant daylight fireball of January 9, 1900 (NATURE, January 25, 1900).","dc.creator":["DENNING, W.

I take it that Prof. Ewart does not mean that the northern Icelandic breed of ponies is a pure one, but only that certain individuals of this breed exhibit the \u201cCeltic\u201d characters in a very marked degree. In a recent paper (Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc., vol. xii., part iv.) Mr. F. H. A. Marshall and I have brought forward both historical and zoological evidence for the mixed origin of the Icelandic pony. It is perhaps worth noting that the people of north Iceland still claim a social superiority over those of the south as being descended chiefly from the second body of colonists which reached the island. In considering the origin of different breeds of the domestic animals ethnological considerations are often. important, and, conversely, the examination of local breeds may sometimes throw light on ethnological problems. For example, in the Malay Peninsula the breed of dogs owned by the majority of the jungle tribes usually classed as Sakais differs from that of the Malay pariah, which has recently been adopted in some cases by Semang tribes and also by those Sakais who live in close intercourse with the Malays. The pariah seems likely to oust the Sakai dog completely, and I am riot aware that any zoologist has yet made a detailed examination of the latter, which shows certain resemblances to the local race of Cyon rutilans.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"70","prism.number":"1805","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"102","prism.endingPage":"102","prism.copyright":"1904 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/070102a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/070102a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/070102a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/070102a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Origin of the Horse","citation_volume":"70","citation_issue":"1805","citation_publication_date":"1904/06","citation_firstpage":"102","citation_lastpage":"102","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/070102a0","DOI":"10.1038/070102a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/070102a0","description":"IN your issue of May 19 (p. 53) Prof. T.

For example, in the Malay Peninsula the breed of dogs owned by the majority of the jungle tribes usually classed as Sakais differs from that of the Malay pariah, which has recently been adopted in some cases by Semang tribes and also by those Sakais who live in close intercourse with the Malays. The pariah seems likely to oust the Sakai dog completely, and I am riot aware that any zoologist has yet made a detailed examination of the latter, which shows certain resemblances to the local race of Cyon rutilans.","dc.creator":["ANNANDALE, NELSON"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["ANNANDALE, NELSON"],"citation_author_institution":["Edinburgh"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Origin of the Horse","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Origin of the Horse&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"070396a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Whilst all felt not only the importance, whether from a purely scientific or from an industrial point of view, of this discovery, and whilst they all applauded Perkin's researches in other branches of science and his modest and retiring hearing throughout, the fact could not be lost sight of that although England was the country in which the coal-tar industry was founded, it had practically, since those days, passed out of our hands into those of the Germans. The cause of this, I remarked, was not due to any want of knowledge or power on the part of Dr. Perkin himself, but rather to the absence of appreciation by capitalists and others engaged in industry of the importance of scientific method, or, in one word, to English Philistinism, the result being that the successful prosecution of a new industry the very existence of which depends on high scientific attainment was impossible. In corroboration of this opinion, which was also expressed in an excellent article in the Times a few days before the meeting, I ventured to direct attention to the fact that, being at that time (fifty years ago) engaged in building up a chemical school at Owens College, I knew three talented young German chemists whose names have since become watchwords in Germany (Caro, Martius, and Pauli) who were then employed in chemical works in Manchester and the neighbourhood.

This point has been discussed in some detail in a recent paper by Bohr (Phil. Mag., September, 1913). The strongest evidence in support of this view is, to my mind, (1) that the \u03b2 ray, like the \u03b1 ray, transformations are independent of physical and chemical conditions, and (2) that the energy emitted in the form of \u03b2 and \u03b3 rays by the transformation of an atom of radium C is much greater than could be expected to be stored up in the external electronic system.

The recommendations are founded upon the idea of the infectiousness of the disease, and are intimately connected with the recognition pf the, protozoon Nosema apis as the cause of the disease and with the knowledge of the ease by which this parasite can be disseminated by infected bees. On account of the practical importance of the subject, I would direct attention to the results of experiments bearing upon these points, carried out by Mr. J. Anderson and Dr, J.

The recommendations are founded upon the idea of the infectiousness of the disease, and are intimately connected with the recognition pf the, protozoon Nosema apis as the cause of the disease and with the knowledge of the ease by which this parasite can be disseminated by infected bees. On account of the practical importance of the subject, I would direct attention to the results of experiments bearing upon these points, carried out by Mr. J. Anderson and Dr, J. Renaie, of the North of Scotland, College of Agriculture and University of Aberdeen, respectively, and communicated at a recent meeting of the Royal Physical Society.

One possible explanation is that females gain benefits because they can avoid using sperm from genetically incompatible males, or invest less in the offspring of such males6,7. It has been shown that mating with more than one male can increase offspring viability8,9,10,11,12, but we present the first clear demonstration that this occurs because females with several mates avoid the negative effects of genetic incompatibility13. We show that in crickets, the eggs of females that mate only with siblings have decreased hatching success. However, if females mate with both a sibling and a non-sibling they avoid altogether the low egg viability associated with sibling matings. If similar effects occur in other species, inbreeding avoidance may be important in understanding the prevalence of multiple mating.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"415","prism.number":"6867","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"71","prism.endingPage":"73","prism.copyright":"2002 Macmillan Magazines Ltd.","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/415071a","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/415071a","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/415071a.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/415071a","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Polyandrous females avoid costs of inbreeding","citation_volume":"415","citation_issue":"6867","citation_publication_date":"2002/01","citation_firstpage":"71","citation_lastpage":"73","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/415071a","DOI":"10.1038/415071a","citation_doi":"10.1038/415071a","description":"Why do females typically mate with more than one male?

It has been shown that mating with more than one male can increase offspring viability8,9,10,11,12, but we present the first clear demonstration that this occurs because females with several mates avoid the negative effects of genetic incompatibility13. We show that in crickets, the eggs of females that mate only with siblings have decreased hatching success. However, if females mate with both a sibling and a non-sibling they avoid altogether the low egg viability associated with sibling matings. If similar effects occur in other species, inbreeding avoidance may be important in understanding the prevalence of multiple mating.","dc.creator":["Tregenza, Tom","Wedell, Nina"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_title=Sexual Selection; citation_publication_date=1994; citation_id=CR1; citation_author=M Andersson","citation_title=Female Control: Sexual Selection by Cryptic Female Choice; citation_publication_date=1996; citation_id=CR2; citation_author=WG Eberhard","citation_journal_title=Proc.

This type of numerical representation of self-action was seen less often in the inferior parietal lobule, and rarely in the primary somatosensory cortex. Such activity in the superior parietal lobule is useful for processing numerical information, which is necessary to provide a foundation for the forthcoming motor selection.","dc.creator":["Sawamura, Hiromasa","Shima, Keisetsu","Tanji, Jun"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Brain Res.; citation_title=Somatosensory properties of neurons in the superior parietal cortex (area 5) of the rhesus monkey.; citation_author=H Sakata, Y Takaoka, A Kawarasaki, H Shibutani; citation_volume=64; citation_publication_date=1973; citation_pages=85-102; citation_doi=10.1016/0006-8993(73)90172-8; citation_id=CR1","citation_title=Handbook of Physiology, Sensory Processes; citation_publication_date=1984; citation_id=CR2; citation_author=VB Mountcastle","citation_journal_title=J.\u00a0Neurophysiol.; citation_title=Posterior parietal association cortex of the monkey: command functions for operations within extrapersonal space.; citation_author=VB Mountcastle, JC Lynch, A Georgopoulos, H Sakata, C Acuna; citation_volume=38; citation_publication_date=1975; citation_pages=871-908; citation_doi=10.1152/jn.1975.38.4.871; citation_id=CR3","citation_journal_title=Brain Res.; citation_title=Activity of neurons in area 5 during a simple arm movement in monkeys before and after deafferentation of the trained limb.; citation_author=J Seal, C Gross, B Bioulac; citation_volume=250; citation_publication_date=1982; citation_pages=229-243; citation_doi=10.1016/0006-8993(82)90417-6; citation_id=CR4","citation_journal_title=Exp.

These findings identify a physiologic role for c-IAP1 and define a mechanism by which TNF-RII-regulated ubiquitin protein ligase activity can potentiate TNF-induced apoptosis.","dc.creator":["Li, Xiaoming","Yang, Yili","Ashwell, Jonathan D."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Cell; citation_title=The TNFR2-TRAF signaling complex contains two novel proteins related to baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis proteins.; citation_author=M Rothe, MG Pan, WJ Henzel, TM Ayres, DV Goeddel; citation_volume=83; citation_publication_date=1995; citation_pages=1243-1252; citation_doi=10.1016/0092-8674(95)90149-3; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Cell; citation_title=TRADD-TRAF2 and TRADD-FADD interactions define two distinct TNF receptor 1 signal transduction pathways.; citation_author=H Hsu, HB Shu, MG Pan, DV Goeddel; citation_volume=84; citation_publication_date=1996; citation_pages=299-308; citation_doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80984-8; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Immunity; citation_title=TRAF2 is essential for JNK but not NF-\u03baB activation and regulates lymphocyte proliferation and survival.; citation_author=SY Lee; citation_volume=7; citation_publication_date=1997; citation_pages=703-713; citation_doi=10.1016/S1074-7613(00)80390-8; citation_id=CR3","citation_journal_title=Immunity; citation_title=Early lethality, functional NF-\u03baB activation, and increased sensitivity to TNF-induced cell death in TRAF2-deficient mice.; citation_author=WC Yeh; citation_volume=7; citation_publication_date=1997; citation_pages=715-725; citation_doi=10.1016/S1074-7613(00)80391-X; citation_id=CR4","citation_journal_title=Proc.

These results suggest that the relatively small number of species known from multiple localities are palaeoecologically informative by themselves, irrespective of the rest of the known species.","dc.creator":["Jernvall, Jukka","Fortelius, Mikael"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_title=Horses; citation_publication_date=1951; citation_id=CR1; citation_author=GG Simpson","citation_journal_title=Evolution; citation_title=A functional index of hypsodonty; citation_author=L Van Valen; citation_volume=14; citation_publication_date=1960; citation_pages=531-532; citation_doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1960.tb03121.x; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Biol.

Tooth decay is normally treated by mechanical removal of the affected part, then filling the hole with a resin or metal alloy. This is less than ideal for tiny early caries lesions as so much healthy tooth must be removed to make fillings stick. A newly developed dental paste of synthetic tooth enamel could avoid that problem. The crystalline white paste is made of modified hydroxyapatite, chemically and structurally similar to natural enamel, and it rapidly and seamlessly repairs an early caries lesion by nanocrystalline growth. This new dental paste can be used to reconstruct enamel without the need for drilling; as an added bonus the process not only repairs the caries lesions but also helps prevent them by strengthening the natural enamel.

Tooth decay is normally treated by mechanical removal of the affected part, then filling the hole with a resin or metal alloy. This is less than ideal for tiny early caries lesions as so much healthy tooth must be removed to make fillings stick. A newly developed dental paste of synthetic tooth enamel could avoid that problem. The crystalline white paste is made of modified hydroxyapatite, chemically and structurally similar to natural enamel, and it rapidly and seamlessly repairs an early caries lesion by nanocrystalline growth. This new dental paste can be used to reconstruct enamel without the need for drilling; as an added bonus the process not only repairs the caries lesions but also helps prevent them by strengthening the natural enamel. The conventional treatment of dental caries involves mechanical removal of the affected part and filling of the hole with a resin or metal alloy1,2,3,4. But this method is not ideal for tiny early lesions5,6 because a disproportionate amount of healthy tooth must be removed to make the alloy or resin stick.

Animals and plants have developed an internal biological clock that uses the light/dark cycle of day and night to synchronize daily rhythms in behaviour and physiological function. Is this circadian rhythm simply an adaptation to make good use of light and dark, or is a daily cycle of activity important to the proper function of an organism? The behaviour of reindeer living at high latitudes above the Arctic Circle provides an answer. Here the Sun neither sets in summer nor rises in winter. In these conditions reindeer lose daily rhythmic activity completely. For herbivores in polar regions at least, there is little selective advantage in maintaining circadian organization.

Animals and plants have developed an internal biological clock that uses the light/dark cycle of day and night to synchronize daily rhythms in behaviour and physiological function. Is this circadian rhythm simply an adaptation to make good use of light and dark, or is a daily cycle of activity important to the proper function of an organism? The behaviour of reindeer living at high latitudes above the Arctic Circle provides an answer. Here the Sun neither sets in summer nor rises in winter. In these conditions reindeer lose daily rhythmic activity completely. For herbivores in polar regions at least, there is little selective advantage in maintaining circadian organization. The light/dark cycle of day and night synchronizes an internal \u2018biological clock\u2019 that governs daily rhythms in behaviour, but this form of regulation is denied to polar animals for most of the year. Here we demonstrate that the continuous lighting conditions of summer and of winter at high latitudes cause a loss in daily rhythmic activity in reindeer living far above the Arctic Circle.

To provide a frame of reference, the phenotype of HT29 death was compared to four other TNF family receptor triggered death events; Fas induced Jurkat cell apoptosis, TNF/zVAD induced L929 fibroblast necrosis, TNF induced death of WEHI 164 fibroblastoid cells and TNF/zVAD induced U937 death. The death of HT29 and U937 cells under these conditions is an intermediate form with both necrotic and apoptotic features. The efficient coupling of TNF receptors to a caspase-independent death event in an epithelial cell suggests an alternative approach to cancer therapy.","dc.creator":["Wilson, C A","Browning, J L"],"dc.subject":["Life Sciences, general","Biochemistry, general","Cell Biology","Stem Cells","Apoptosis","Cell Cycle Analysis"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Oncogene; citation_title=More than one way to die: apoptosis, necrosis and reactive oxygen damage; citation_author=W Fiers, R Beyaert, W Declercq, P Vandenabeele; citation_volume=18; citation_publication_date=1999; citation_pages=7719-7730; citation_doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1203249; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=The biochemistry of apoptosis; citation_author=MO Hengartner; citation_volume=407; citation_publication_date=2000; citation_pages=770-776; citation_doi=10.1038/35037710; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Annu.

But these data by themselves still permit an open universe of low mass density and no cosmological constant.

Exit from mitosis in yeast involves accumulation of the cyclin kinase inhibitor Sic1 as well as cyclin proteolysis mediated by APC/C bound by the activating subunit Cdh1/Hct1 (APCCdh1)2,3. Both processes require the Cdc14 phosphatase, whose release from the nucleolus during anaphase causes dephosphorylation and thereby activation of Cdh1 and accumulation of another protein, Sic1 (refs 4,5,6,7). We do not know what determines the release of Cdc14 and enables it to promote Cdk1 inactivation, but it is known to be dependent on APC/C bound by Cdc20 (APCCdc20) (ref. 4).

Lensfree on-chip microscopy decouples resolution from FOV and can achieve a space-bandwidth product greater than one billion under unit magnification using state-of-the-art opto-electronic sensor chips and pixel super-resolution techniques. However, using vertical illumination, the effective numerical aperture (NA) that can be achieved with an on-chip microscope is limited by a poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at high spatial frequencies and imaging artifacts that arise as a result of the relatively narrow acceptance angles of the sensor's pixels. Here, we report, for the first time, a synthetic aperture-based on-chip microscope in which the illumination angle is scanned across the surface of a dome to increase the effective NA of the reconstructed lensfree image to 1.4, achieving e.g., \u223c250-nm resolution at 700-nm wavelength under unit magnification. This synthetic aperture approach not only represents the largest NA achieved to date using an on-chip microscope but also enables color imaging of connected tissue samples, such as pathology slides, by achieving robust phase recovery without the need for multi-height scanning or any prior information about the sample. To validate the effectiveness of this synthetic aperture-based, partially coherent, holographic on-chip microscope, we have successfully imaged color-stained cancer tissue slides as well as unstained Papanicolaou smears across a very large FOV of 20.5 mm2. This compact on-chip microscope based on a synthetic aperture approach could be useful for various applications in medicine, physical sciences and engineering that demand high-resolution wide-field imaging. An on-chip microscope that offers both a high-resolution and a wide field of view looks set to benefit the biological and physical sciences.

Lensfree on-chip microscopy decouples resolution from FOV and can achieve a space-bandwidth product greater than one billion under unit magnification using state-of-the-art opto-electronic sensor chips and pixel super-resolution techniques. However, using vertical illumination, the effective numerical aperture (NA) that can be achieved with an on-chip microscope is limited by a poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at high spatial frequencies and imaging artifacts that arise as a result of the relatively narrow acceptance angles of the sensor's pixels. Here, we report, for the first time, a synthetic aperture-based on-chip microscope in which the illumination angle is scanned across the surface of a dome to increase the effective NA of the reconstructed lensfree image to 1.4, achieving e.g., \u223c250-nm resolution at 700-nm wavelength under unit magnification. This synthetic aperture approach not only represents the largest NA achieved to date using an on-chip microscope but also enables color imaging of connected tissue samples, such as pathology slides, by achieving robust phase recovery without the need for multi-height scanning or any prior information about the sample. To validate the effectiveness of this synthetic aperture-based, partially coherent, holographic on-chip microscope, we have successfully imaged color-stained cancer tissue slides as well as unstained Papanicolaou smears across a very large FOV of 20.5 mm2. This compact on-chip microscope based on a synthetic aperture approach could be useful for various applications in medicine, physical sciences and engineering that demand high-resolution wide-field imaging. An on-chip microscope that offers both a high-resolution and a wide field of view looks set to benefit the biological and physical sciences. The lensfree imaging device, developed by researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles, CA, USA, makes use a synthetic aperture approach to provide a very large effective numerical aperture of 1.4 over a field of view of >20 mm2; this is a much larger numerical aperture than previous lensfree approaches had realized (<0.9).

Various super-resolution techniques have been implemented to mitigate this resolution loss by utilizing sub-pixel displacements in the imaging system, achieved, for example, by shifting the illumination source, the sensor array and/or the sample, followed by digital synthesis of a smaller effective pixel by merging these sub-pixel-shifted low-resolution images. Herein, we introduce a new pixel super-resolution method that is based on wavelength scanning and demonstrate that as an alternative to physical shifting/displacements, wavelength diversity can be used to boost the resolution of a wide-field imaging system and significantly increase its space-bandwidth product. We confirmed the effectiveness of this new technique by improving the resolution of lens-free as well as lens-based microscopy systems and developed an iterative algorithm to generate high-resolution reconstructions of a specimen using undersampled diffraction patterns recorded at a few wavelengths covering a narrow spectrum (10\u201330\u2009nm). When combined with a synthetic-aperture-based diffraction imaging technique, this wavelength-scanning super-resolution approach can achieve a half-pitch resolution of 250\u2009nm, corresponding to a numerical aperture of ~1.0, across a large field of view (>20\u2009mm2). We also demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach by imaging various biological samples, including blood and Papanicolaou smears. Compared with displacement-based super-resolution techniques, wavelength scanning brings uniform resolution improvement in all directions across a sensor array and requires significantly fewer measurements. This technique would broadly benefit wide-field imaging applications that demand larger space-bandwidth products. A new way to obtain high-resolution images over wide fields of view that involves scanning the wavelength has been demonstrated by a US team. The resolution of many imaging systems, particularly wide-field microscopes, is limited by undersampling and pixelation. Conventionally, this problem has been remedied by physically shifting the light source, sample or detector. Now, Aydogan Ozcan and co-workers at the University of California, Los Angeles propose a new solution\u2014successively illuminating the sample at a few wavelengths over a narrow range (10\u201330\u2009nanometres). This method has two main advantages over physical scanning: it requires fewer measurements and results in uniform enhancement of the resolution over the entire sample plane.

Although information is not lost, its recovery requires a coherent interferometric reconstruction of the original signals, which have been scrambled into the modes of the scattering system. Here we show that we can automatically unscramble optical beams that have been arbitrarily mixed in a multimode waveguide, undoing the scattering and mixing between the spatial modes through a mesh of silicon photonics tuneable beam splitters. Transparent light detectors integrated in a photonic chip are used to directly monitor the evolution of each mode along the mesh, allowing sequential tuning and adaptive individual feedback control of each beam splitter. The entire mesh self-configures automatically through a progressive tuning algorithm and resets itself after significantly perturbing the mixing, without turning off the beams. We demonstrate information recovery by the simultaneous unscrambling, sorting and tracking of four mixed modes, with residual cross-talk of \u221220\u2009dB between the beams. Circuit partitioning assisted by transparent detectors enables scalability to meshes with a higher port count and to a higher number of modes without a proportionate increase in the control complexity. The principle of self-configuring and self-resetting in optical systems should be applicable in a wide range of optical applications. A silicon photonics chip featuring a mesh of tunable beam splitters can unscramble mode mixing that occurs in multimode waveguides. Scattering or multimode systems can randomize the spatial coherence of light beams. Francesco Morichetti and co-workers from Politecnico di Milano, Italy, and Stanford University, USA, have fabricated a chip-based descrambler that can automatically unscramble optical beams. A progressive tuning algorithm that monitors the output of the chip enables the mesh to self-configure so that it can unscramble and sort different spatial modes. In a demonstration of the device, four optical beams containing mixed modes were unmixed and separated into outputs with a residual crosstalk of less than \u221220\u2009dB between the modes.

Here we describe the design and experimental realization of the first single-mode stretchable photonic devices. These devices, made of chalcogenide glass and epoxy polymer materials, are monolithically integrated on elastomer substrates. To impart mechanical stretching capability to devices built using these intrinsically brittle materials, our design strategy involves local substrate stiffening to minimize shape deformation of critical photonic components, and interconnecting optical waveguides assuming a meandering Euler spiral geometry to mitigate radiative optical loss. Devices fabricated following such design can sustain 41% nominal tensile strain and 3000 stretching cycles without measurable degradation in optical performance. In addition, we present a rigorous analytical model to quantitatively predict stress-optical coupling behavior in waveguide devices of arbitrary geometry without using a single fitting parameter. A stretchable material for creating optical components could form the basis of wearable health monitors. Flexible electronics and photonics offer a way of integrating devices into clothing or attaching components directly to the skin. But many applications require optical materials that are both bendable and stretchable. Juejun Hu from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA, and co-workers have incorporated a chalcogenide glass and an epoxy polymer into an elastomer substrate. This choice of materials permits the seamlessly integration of photonic components with both high and low index contrasts in the same platform. While the glass and epoxy are intrinsically brittle, the composite material is stretchy because the optical components are located in \u2018islands\u2019 and interconnected by optical waveguides with a serpentine shape.

We also found indications of an overall anti-oxidative effect, as the total anti-oxidative potential, catalase activity and protein levels, and manganese superoxide dismutase protein levels increased significantly (P<0.05) in both cell lines after treatment with adiponectin. Lower levels of adiponectin in obese individuals may result in higher levels of prostatic OS, which may explain the clinical association between obesity, hypoadiponectinemia and PC.","prism.publicationName":"Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases","prism.publicationDate":"2012-01-17","prism.volume":"15","prism.number":"1","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"28","prism.endingPage":"35","prism.copyright":"2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/pcan201153","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/pcan.2011.53","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/pcan201153.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/pcan201153","citation_journal_title":"Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases","citation_journal_abbrev":"Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-5608","citation_title":"Adiponectin inhibits oxidative stress in human prostate carcinoma cells","citation_volume":"15","citation_issue":"1","citation_publication_date":"2012/03","citation_online_date":"2012/01/17","citation_firstpage":"28","citation_lastpage":"35","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/pcan.2011.53","DOI":"10.1038/pcan.2011.53","citation_doi":"10.1038/pcan.2011.53","description":"Emerging data suggest that obesity increases the risk of aggressive prostate cancer (PC), but the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain to be fully elucidated.
