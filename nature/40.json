I was able to take it quietly, because I knew I was in the right.

It was about half-past eleven in the morning when the first shocks were felt. Then followed the most frightful oscillations which lasted forty-five or fifty seconds, or, according to other observers, even over a minute. These oscillations were regular measured cadences, and violent, like the rocking of a ship in a storm. According to the indications of the pendulum, they were first in the direction S.E.\u2014N.W., later N.E.\u2014S.W. Many persons became sea-sick.

It presents one of the most beautiful contrivances with which I have hitherto met for securing a cross through the agency of insects. The corolla consists of five petals united into one piece and folded into the form of a two-lipped tube, the upper lip of which is formed by the over-lapping edges of the corolla; while the lower lip is a somewhat cup-shaped appendage (c), furnished with a \u201cbeard\u201d of gland-like bodies (b), and opening in front by a narrow, vertical slit. The filaments of the stamens are united throughout the greater part of their length with the corolla, but expand within the cup of the lower lip into a two-lobed membrane, crowned by the anthers (a). The pistil has two stigmas, one of which (s) is placed at right angles to the upper side of the style and is perfect, while the other (s\u2032) is transformed into a spoon-shaped, petaloid prolongation of the pistil, reaching to the opening of the lower lip of the corolla, and dividing the interior of the flower into two chambers, in the lower of which are the stamens, thus completely separated from the true stigma. The entrance to the flower, below the style and in front of the stamens, is closed by hairs pointing outwards from the flower and meeting in front, on the mouse-trap principle; but a narrow passage is left open above the petaloid stigma, and is perhaps capable of a slight distension from the flexibility of the overlapping petals.

The lectures in question are perfect models of what lectures should be, and while reading them I pictured to myself the rich feast that had been prepared for the people who were fortunate enough to hear them\u2014especially for those who had some previous acquaintance with the subjects of which they treat. They are couched in simple language, so that those who run may read. They are strictly to the point, well calculated to excite further inquiry, and in every way adapted for the purpose for which they were intended. It may be, however, doubted, whether lectures on scientific subjects before the general public, however delivered, do that amount of good which they certainly ought to do.

The lectures in question are perfect models of what lectures should be, and while reading them I pictured to myself the rich feast that had been prepared for the people who were fortunate enough to hear them\u2014especially for those who had some previous acquaintance with the subjects of which they treat. They are couched in simple language, so that those who run may read. They are strictly to the point, well calculated to excite further inquiry, and in every way adapted for the purpose for which they were intended. It may be, however, doubted, whether lectures on scientific subjects before the general public, however delivered, do that amount of good which they certainly ought to do. A lecture to be thoroughly and lastingly effective presupposes a certain acquaintance with the subject already.

Towards half-past six the redness became more concentrated, gradually brightened, and finally became of a most intense brilliancy\u2014indeed, so much so that it fairly baffles description, the landscape and the countenances of those standing near being visibly tinged. Streamers soon began to form, and shoot gradually upwards from the horizon in all directions from N.E. by S. to W., some intensely red, some very white, while others were of a greenish hue. The red and white being very brilliant, were finely intermingled, especially in a N. E. direction, while a muddy green prevailed chiefly in the S., and a reddish tinge in the W. By seven o'clock that rare phenomenon, a corona, was formed overhead, assuming a variety of shapes. The most curious part of the display (as far as my experience goes) was the entire absence up to this time of any streamers or coloured haze in a W. by N. to N.E. direction, the sky being cloudless, perfectly clear, and the stars shining with their usual brightness. On the formation of the corona a sheet of fan-shaped sea-green haze shot from it in a N. direction, spreading rapidly as it advanced, but did not proceed for more than 20\u00b0, when it suddenly disappeared. The streamers were remarkably steady throughout and straight, unlike those during the display of November 10 of last year, which were wave-like, rapid, and flickering. By half-past seven the entire sky had assumed a greenish tinge, with a reddish glow in some places, and a few resplendent beams of white light from the E. chiefly. At a quarter to eight red streamers became visible in a N. direction, at a considerable elevation, resting on a greenish haze, itself emanating from a very indistinctly white arch spread across the N. At nine the sky was still tinged, and a streamer here and there visible, but by ten the display was over, as clouds had obscured the heavens. Although the red colours were so intense and deep, the stars could be distinctly seen through them, and when the streamers suddenly changed to white, &c, it was possible to see the time on a watch, though the night under ordinary circumstances would have been dark.

TYLOR speaks of vampires as illustrations of Savage Animism, and regards them as inventions to explain wasting disease. The records of such unseen agents point to two classes of vampires, one of which has nothing to do with wasting disease. To take two extreme cases: the story of Grettir's conflict with Glam the house churl, contrasts with the Vampire Cat of Nabeshimes, as told by Mitford in the \u201cTales of Old Japan.\u201d The Northern hero seeks the evil one and overpowers him, but his success is dearly bought, for evil temper and nervousness never leave him, and his after life is unlucky from these two causes. The Japanese Prince is visited nightly by the counterfeit of his lovely concubine, he pines away, and is only saved by the energy of a retainer, who slays the fair persecutor. Here are types of two kinds of malady; one is truly wasting, the other is of that kind which ends in apoplexy, epilepsy, acute mania, or if death is not speedy and sudden, dyspepsia may reduce the hero to Grettir's state without obviously impairing his strength. The Japanese story gives the common superstition among polygamous people with whom progressive exhaustion is not uncommon, as \u201cHawke's Voyages\u201d quaintly explain. The Grettir Saga gives a pagan version of what figures more than once in Christian legends as saintly intervention. Thus, the Scandinavian invader blasphemes the English saint, who straightway appears to him, and points the finger; the blasphemer drops down dead. Glam, the churl, gorges himself with food, and goes to the hill, the next morning he is found crushed and distorted, and the horror of his punishment is proportioned to his crime, for he ate meat on a Church fast, and it was doubtless sweet to his neighbours to recall the fact that they heard his shrieks when sitting in church. Glam's successors perish violently, one of them being found convulsed and broken on Glam's cairn, just as in more places than one in Scotland men have been found in convulsions near places which superstition had made terrible on account of some great crime. But Grettir, for twenty years after his fight with Glam, leads a life of incessant fighting as an outlaw. He cannot go alone, his nerve is shaken, he sees things in the dark, and his temper is irritable. It is of course impossible to separate out the various forms of unseeen agency to which men in rude times were subject. But the Vampires of the North and Incubi are members of the same family; the Vampires of Asia belong to another family. The former represent indigestion, the results of gross overeating and drinking, aggravated, doubtless, by the circumstances that the opportunities of excess were not frequent, and that semi-starvations occurred often between copious meals. The demons are mostly men; in all cases they give rise to violent conflicts, in which, if a man dies, his distorted convulsed body suggests the presence of a corporeal enemy, a reasonable enough notion among those to whom natural death meant, in the case of a strong man, death by the sword. The latter represents the results of lechery in some form or other; there is no tale of conflict, though now and then sudden death is accompanied by convulsions such as, we know, frequently terminate cases of general paralysis and Tabes dorsalis. The correspondence between the Northern Berserker and the furious Malay who runs amuck, is interesting in reference to this contrast The insanity of the Berserker is that of an individual; the persecution of the Northern vampire falls on the whole family of the sufferer; and, while it is difficult under ordinary circumstances for any large number of people to become simultanequsly affected by genuine fury (though Mr. Wallace furnishes a possible analogy to ancient custom in what we may call a sociable Amok), the contagion of fear makes it easily intelligible how even a district might come to see and hear what had no existence save in the disturbed imagination of one.

They are: \u201cgirth of trunk, 18 inches,\u201d i.e., about 5 inches for its width; \u201cexpanse of wing from tip to tip across the body, 5 feet,\u201d so that each wing would stretch about 331/2 inches from root to tip; \u201cacross secondaries, 7 inches,\u201d and this we may take as about the average width of the wing.

They are: \u201cgirth of trunk, 18 inches,\u201d i.e., about 5 inches for its width; \u201cexpanse of wing from tip to tip across the body, 5 feet,\u201d so that each wing would stretch about 331/2 inches from root to tip; \u201cacross secondaries, 7 inches,\u201d and this we may take as about the average width of the wing.

I have not myself passed the watershed at the Lesjeskaagen Lake, though I was close to it in August last, and would have examined it if I had known its importance; but I know enough of the locality to think that Colonel Greenwood is probably right in his explanation of it. But there is another, which I have passed, and which is situated on perhaps the most frequented route in Norway, viz. that from L\u00e6rdals\u00f6ren over the Fille Fjeld, to which I hardly think the same explanation would apply. Between Nystuen and Skogstad is a chain of lakes crossing the watershed, the highest of which (not the one marked on the Vei-cart over Norge, I think) sends its waters to the west, past Nystuen to the Sogne Fjord, at L\u00e6rdals\u00f6ren, and on the east by the Lille Mj\u00f6sen, and Aadalen to the Tyrifjord, and so past Drammen to the Christiania Fjord.

It is possible that nocturnal Lepidoptera are the fertilisers of the fumitory; in this case it would be most probable that the pale colour of its flowers has been acquired by natural selection, pale flowers being most conspicuous in the dusk. 2.

It is possible that nocturnal Lepidoptera are the fertilisers of the fumitory; in this case it would be most probable that the pale colour of its flowers has been acquired by natural selection, pale flowers being most conspicuous in the dusk. 2.

K\u00e6semtz's \u201cMeteorology,\u201d in which almost every feature of the weather capable of being chronicled has been fully catalogued, probably contains a list more or less complete, up to its author's time, of all then known descriptions of auroras. If this be so, it has probably served for the groundwork upon which later and more complete catalogues have been compiled, extended, and completed in his own and other countries. Dr. Heis, the director of the Prussian Observatory at M\u00fcnster, in Westphalia, is especially active in collecting information of the slightest appearances of aurora in any quarters of the globe, from whence published or private descriptions of them can be obtained.

Symons's Monthly Meteorological Magazine and the Quarterly Journal of the Scottish Meteorological Society contains, in a few pages of \u201cmeteorological notes\u201d on the weather peculiarities of each month from their numerous observers, a list of scattered aurora-observations, which is probably as complete for the British Isles during the years in which these publications have been carried on, as the perfect or partial clearness of the sky over this country, and indeed over some adjacent continental stations, enables such a list to be made by observations. But this collection, invaluable as it is for our own immediate field of registry, I is not assorted, nor suited, without extension by the help of similar collections made in surrounding foreign countries, to be regarded as a sufficiently extensive list of auroras for dealing generally with the question of their periodicity. The present state of progress of our knowledge, with regard to auroral frequency, we owe largely, if not almost entirely, to the researches of Prof. E. Loomis, of Yale College, U.S., the results of whose discussion of the collateral views and considerations involved in them will be found in numbers of the American Journal of Science for July 1860, Sept. 1870, and April 1873. In the first of these papers, a map of lines of equal auroral frequency for the northern hemisphere is presented, dividing the northern area of the globe into zones encircling the arctic regions. It appears, for example, from this map, that auroral displays are not very much more frequently visible in St. Petersburg than they are in London, and that even Boston and Edinburgh are as frequently visited by them as the great northern capital itself. An oval belt of greatest auroral frequency encloses together the northgeographica and north magnetic poles, covering all the European, Asiatic, and American coast lines of the Arctic Ocean, and passing onwards from the latter across Hudson's Bay, the mouth of Baffin's Bay, and Iceland, back to the North Cape. For a short distance within this ample belt auroras continue to be tolerably frequent, and grow comparatively more scarce in Smith's Sound and the northern parts of Baffin's Bay, and indeed apparently in proportion as the geographical north polar regions are approached.* It is with the outer and not with the inner margin, however, of this ring-maximum of auroras that observers in ordinary latitudes are concerned, and it is pointed out in his most recent paper by Prof. Loomis, that in constructing general catalogues for deciding questions of auroral periodicity, a line, or at least a restricted zone, bordered northwards and southwards by lines of equal auroral frequency, should be chosen as the localities from which observations may be gathered. To place this line or belt in the zone itself of almost constant auroral activity, where auroras can only vary periodically in brightness rather than in frequency, would be of no avail for enumerations; the zone selected must be one of occasional auroras, arising only from the southward spreading of the strongest disturbances of the ever-beaming and sometimes forth-sallying illuminations of the north.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"10","prism.number":"260","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"500","prism.endingPage":"502","prism.copyright":"1874 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/010500b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/010500b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/010500b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/010500b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Periodicity of Auroras","citation_volume":"10","citation_issue":"260","citation_publication_date":"1874/10","citation_firstpage":"500","citation_lastpage":"502","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/010500b0","DOI":"10.1038/010500b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/010500b0","description":"ON my return to Newcastle-on-Tyne I take the opportunity of being able to recur to books of reference to reply to a question put by Mr. Procter, in NATURE (vol. x. p. 355), whether any complete catalogues of auroras have been constructed, and if they show indications of periodicity in its displays. K\u00e6semtz's \u201cMeteorology,\u201d in which almost every feature of the weather capable of being chronicled has been fully catalogued, probably contains a list more or less complete, up to its author's time, of all then known descriptions of auroras. If this be so, it has probably served for the groundwork upon which later and more complete catalogues have been compiled, extended, and completed in his own and other countries.

THOMAS DAVIDSON, F.R.S., describes, on p. 275, and figures, in pl. xxxiv. of the Supplement to his \u201cCarboniferous Brachiopoda,\u201d now on the eve of publication, some important points in the structure of Spirifera lineata, Martin, which specimens in my collection have revealed. In this species the shell structure is minutely punctate, and the flattened spines, which are usually broken off short, contain in their interior a double canal, that terminates upon the outer surface of the shell in a series of double pores. I have recently been fortunate enough to find a specimen from the High Blantyre limestone shales having the spines in place. It appears that these spines are provided with numerous marginal opposite booklets usually pointing towards the free end of the spine.

THOMAS DAVIDSON, F.R.S., describes, on p. 275, and figures, in pl. xxxiv. of the Supplement to his \u201cCarboniferous Brachiopoda,\u201d now on the eve of publication, some important points in the structure of Spirifera lineata, Martin, which specimens in my collection have revealed. In this species the shell structure is minutely punctate, and the flattened spines, which are usually broken off short, contain in their interior a double canal, that terminates upon the outer surface of the shell in a series of double pores. I have recently been fortunate enough to find a specimen from the High Blantyre limestone shales having the spines in place. It appears that these spines are provided with numerous marginal opposite booklets usually pointing towards the free end of the spine. So far as I am aware, this structure is unique amongst the brachiopods. Mr. Davidson has kindly undertaken to note this interesting fact in the explanation of the plates of his forthcoming monograph, the text having been printed off before this observation was made; but I should like to draw the attention of pal\u00e6ontologists to the point, as perhaps similar structures may be found in other brachiopods.

The point is to account for the circumstance (admitting that it is rendered necessary by physical evidence) that the velocity of propagation of gravity must, at least, be very much greater than that of light. I will merely confine myself here to recapitulating one of the main conclusions in a somewhat different form, viz., it appears to be necessary to look to a separate medium for gravity, or (more accurately) to one medium with particles of two grades of dimensions; the one set of particles having very minute mass, and consequently enormous velocity, and concerned in the effects of gravity; the other set, of much greater mass and slower velocity, concerned in the phenomena of light. It will, I think, be so far tolerably evident that if the number of the more minute set of particles be comparatively very great, the pressure produced by them would be correspondingly great, and therefore these particles would be mainly (i.e., almost exclusively, if their number were sufficiently great)1 concerned in producing gravity. On the other hand, on account of the extreme velocity of these particles, they could not apparently be appreciably concerned in the phenomena of light, since the molecules of gross matter would vibrate among them without appreciable resistance. For it is a well-known dynamical fact that the resistance opposed to the motion of a body in a medium diminishes as the velocity of the particles of the medium increases.

I think your readers may be interested to learn that I have frequently noticed Medus\u00e6 in a similar position in the West Indies. A few years ago I was quartered for some time at Port Royal, Jamaica, and in the channels between the mangroves I observed what I at first thought were Actine\u00e6 of large size on the muddy bottom, in about eight feet of water. They were very numerous. I stirred one up with the boat-hook, and was surprised to find it was a Medusa tamed upside down. On being disturbed, it lazily contracted its umbrella in the usual manner and settled down again in the mud as before. The species was about a foot in diameter of umbrella, and dirty white in colour. I never saw them swimming in the mangrove creeks, though I was frequently out in a boat, and they were at all times common on the bottom, lying as described. Some time afterwards I saw what seemed to be the same species at St. George's Bay, a small island about ten miles from Belize, Honduras. It was lying in the same position on the mud amongst the mangroves, in about four feet of water, I poked several up with a stick, and they slowly swam for a short distance, and again settled down on their umbrellas. I believe it to be really the habit of the species to lie on its back, as it were, and it is interesting to find another kind in the east acting similarly. Mangrove swamps are extensive in the vicinity of Singapore, but I have not noticed any Medus\u00e6 here in that position, possibly because there is a considerable tide which leaves the mud bare at low water.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"24","prism.number":"614","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"307","prism.endingPage":"307","prism.copyright":"1881 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/024307b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/024307b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/024307b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/024307b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Medus\u00e6","citation_volume":"24","citation_issue":"614","citation_publication_date":"1881/08","citation_firstpage":"307","citation_lastpage":"307","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/024307b0","DOI":"10.1038/024307b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/024307b0","description":"IN Mr. H.

Mangrove swamps are extensive in the vicinity of Singapore, but I have not noticed any Medus\u00e6 here in that position, possibly because there is a considerable tide which leaves the mud bare at low water.","dc.creator":["ARCHER, H."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["ARCHER, H."],"citation_author_institution":["Fort Canning, Singapore"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Medus\u00e6","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Medus&#230;&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"024358a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The origin of the spot's disappearance was obvious. A dark mass on the north border of the great south belt (and therefore in the same latitude as the white spot) appeared on December 14; it followed the white spot 1h. 4m., according to observations by Mr. A. S. Williams at Brighton. The dark spot moved with more rapidity than the latter, and soon overtook it, so that as the former swept over it, its disappearance was complete. On January 6 the white spot was seen struggling through the southeast limits of the dark patch. On January 7 it had further freed itself, and I saw it much plainer, though it still continued somewhat faint.

The origin of the spot's disappearance was obvious. A dark mass on the north border of the great south belt (and therefore in the same latitude as the white spot) appeared on December 14; it followed the white spot 1h. 4m., according to observations by Mr. A. S. Williams at Brighton. The dark spot moved with more rapidity than the latter, and soon overtook it, so that as the former swept over it, its disappearance was complete. On January 6 the white spot was seen struggling through the southeast limits of the dark patch. On January 7 it had further freed itself, and I saw it much plainer, though it still continued somewhat faint. On January 9 it was bright, and evidently on the point of regaining its normal brilliancy. The dark patch referred to is obviously of the same character as the train of black spots visible on one of the northern belts last winter; they move with even greater velocity than the white spot, and are somewhat evanescent as regards duration.

Orthoptera were represented by the ubiquitous cockroach, and a few Acridiid\u00e6.","dc.creator":["FORBES, HENRY O."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["FORBES, HENRY O."],"citation_author_institution":["Fatunaba, Timor Dilly"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Fauna and Flora of the Keeling Islands,...","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Fauna and Flora of the Keeling Islands, Indian Ocean&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"028101a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

They are not so well accommodated as I could wish, owing to their great length, 6 or 7 feet; still they are to be seen very distinctly, doubled up in a glass jar, 3 feet 5 inches in height, filled with strong alcohol clear as water. The fine specimen of Cryptochiton stelleri, collected and contributed by His Excellency the Marquis of Lornee, was also found by your reader to be properly exhibited in a convenient glass jar, and labelled inside and out. The large and interesting collection of marine invertebrates exhibited by the Government of the Dominion of Canada is formed of collections contributed by the Museum of McGill College, Montreal, Laval University, Quebec, and from the Nova Scotia Provincial Museum. The collection of Edible Mollusca was made by the late John R.

W. Backhouse in NATURE, January 10 (p. 251) may prove to be of considerable importance, I beg to add my observations of it on the 12th. I had noticed a mass of ruddy colour under the given conditions, previously, but had not detected its strange nature. The sunset on the 11th was very fine. The 12th, until after sunset, was cloudless, except for the hazy masses which seem to precede every sunrise, and, more especially, sunset, at present. Our sunshine record is an unbroken scorch from 9.15 a.m. to 2.52 p.m. (sun seen clear of horizon at 8.26, and touched at 4.0); I doubt if, previously, we have recorded even five hours in early January. At 7.45 a.m. on the 12th (sun rose at 8.22) the cloud-glow had turned to silvery green below, and rose from 15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 in the south-east. At 7.47 the rose reached 60\u00b0, but was fainter. I first noticed the \u201chalo\u201d at 7.52. It was then so well defined that, calling a lady's attention by asking what she saw there, she spoke of it as \u201ca broad rainbow.\u201d Position, by compass, 30\u00b0 north of west. It was a semicircle situated 10\u00b0 above the horizon, standing on the dark gray arch of dawn, Jupiter being on a line with the base of the left end of the rosy arch.

W. Backhouse in NATURE, January 10 (p. 251) may prove to be of considerable importance, I beg to add my observations of it on the 12th. I had noticed a mass of ruddy colour under the given conditions, previously, but had not detected its strange nature. The sunset on the 11th was very fine. The 12th, until after sunset, was cloudless, except for the hazy masses which seem to precede every sunrise, and, more especially, sunset, at present. Our sunshine record is an unbroken scorch from 9.15 a.m. to 2.52 p.m. (sun seen clear of horizon at 8.26, and touched at 4.0); I doubt if, previously, we have recorded even five hours in early January. At 7.45 a.m. on the 12th (sun rose at 8.22) the cloud-glow had turned to silvery green below, and rose from 15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 in the south-east. At 7.47 the rose reached 60\u00b0, but was fainter. I first noticed the \u201chalo\u201d at 7.52. It was then so well defined that, calling a lady's attention by asking what she saw there, she spoke of it as \u201ca broad rainbow.\u201d Position, by compass, 30\u00b0 north of west. It was a semicircle situated 10\u00b0 above the horizon, standing on the dark gray arch of dawn, Jupiter being on a line with the base of the left end of the rosy arch. The inner arc of this measured 10\u00b0, and the outer 24\u00b0 in radius, but it spread out to 30\u00b0 at the base. The centre was of the same blue as the sky to the right and left of the rosy semicircle, above the gray. The base, sinking faster than Jupiter, spread out so that, at 8 o'clock, the arch having now broken above, its outline was rather like a railway chair.

Darwin and Hawksley, have opened an interesting question, and one which seems to be but imperfectly understood. The true explanation of this vexed question has for some years appeared to me to be that to which it is attributed by Mr. Hawksley, namely, inequality in the length of the legs. A few years ago I made some investigations on the length of the lower limbs in man, the results of which were published in the Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, vol. xiii. p. 502 (1879). I found that of seventy well-authenticated skeletons which I examined, the lower limbs were equal in length in only seven instances, or in 10 per cent.; in twenty-five instances, or 35.8 per cent., the right limb was longer than the left, while in thirty-eight instances, or 54.3 per cent., the left limb was longer than the right. The left leg I found not only to be more frequently longer than the right, but the difference in length between the two limbs is greater on an average when the left is the longer. Inequality in length is not confined to any particular age, sex, or race, but seems to be universal in all respects. My observations corroborated those of several American surgeons made on the living subject. The result of one limb being longer than the other will naturally be that a person will unconsciously take a longer step with the longer limb, and consequently will circle to the right or to the left according as the left or right leg is the longer, unless the tendency to deviation is corrected by the eye. The left leg being more frequently the longer, circling should, if this theory of its being due to inequality of the limbs be correct, take place more frequently to the right than to the left. This is precisely what we find to obtain, and in this respect Messrs. Larden, Darwin, and Hawksley's observations agree with some I made myself on this question. The diameter of the circle formed by those circling to the right should, if my observations on the skeletons be correct, be less than that made by those circling to the left, since the difference in length between the two limbs is greater when the left is the longer.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"29","prism.number":"744","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"310","prism.endingPage":"310","prism.copyright":"1884 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029310c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/029310c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029310c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029310c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Unconscious Bias in Walking","citation_volume":"29","citation_issue":"744","citation_publication_date":"1884/01","citation_firstpage":"310","citation_lastpage":"310","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/029310c0","DOI":"10.1038/029310c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/029310c0","description":"MR.

It is a female of the same species 8.6 inches in length, in which he caudal fin differs from that of the male example in that its form is lanceolate.

If we can suppose that a whiting can live at such a depth, we can suppose also that the eye might become larger and the body rather shorter, proportionally, but otherwise it is a distinct species and yet nearly alike; but from the latitude, and especially the longitude, it is scarcely a British fish.\u201d","dc.creator":["DAY, FRANCIS"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["DAY, FRANCIS"],"citation_author_institution":["Cheltenham"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"On the Occurrence of Lumpenus Lampetriformis...","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;Emphasis Type=&quot;Bold&quot;&gt;On the Occurrence of...","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"032245b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The curious way in which my book has been misunderstood, and my consequent endeavour to put matters in a clear and impartial light, must be my apology for taking up your valuable space. In the first place, Mr. Romanes finds fault with the title of my book; but why, it is hard to conjecture. I venture to assert that nine-tenths of the matter it contains attempt to illustrate the operation of evolution without any natural selective process, as any impartial reader must admit; consequently, I absolutely deny that I only reserved a few odds and ends of small detail which I ascribed to other agencies. I might also state that I had a reason, and I think a very good one, in confining my remarks exclusively to birds. Had I elected to cover a wider area, I could have shown that these \u201codds and ends,\u201d as Mr. Romanes somewhat contemptuously calls them, do not by any means exclusively apply to birds, but to species in every other department of natural history. Mr. Romanes goes on to say that \u201cIt is the very essence of the Darwinian hypothesis that it only seeks to explain the apparently purposive variations, or variations of an adaptive kind; and, therefore, if any variations are taken to be non-adaptive, exhypothesi they cannot have been due to natural selection.\u201d Precisely. And it was the immense amount of what I may call non-purposive variation which forms the line of demarcation between such vast numbers of species that I have attempted to explain by other agencies when natural selection utterly fails to do so. I most emphatically deny that I ever said, or even inferred, that these variations are \u201cfor the most part rare,\u201d as Mr. Romanes leads the reader of his review to suppose. All naturalists who are in the habit of working through large series of specimens are well aware of the immense number of species whose claim to rank as such is based upon their slight variation from a dominant type. It took me five years' hard work amongst tens of thousands of specimens to arrive at the conclusions expressed in my little book; and, in my opinion, no naturalist is qualified to write on these subjects without serving such an apprenticeship. That is why, as a specialist, I confined myself to birds alone for my examples. In the face of the array of important facts which I endeavoured to chronicle, it seems strange for a naturalist of such standing as Mr. Romanes to state that these facts \u201cmay be freely presented to the anti-Darwinians.\u201d Why \u201canti-Darwinians,\u201d Mr. Romanes? No one but an evolutionist (and most evolutionists are surely Darwinians) would attach any importance to these \u201ctrivial variations,\u201d and consequent intergradation of specific forms. Mr. Romanes is careful to point out how Darwin himself admits that if these trivial specific characters are \u201creally of no considerable importance in the struggle for life, they could not be modified or formed through natural selection.\u201d Now probably it is no exaggeration to say that at least one-third of the known recognised species absolutely rest on these \u201ctrivial specific characters.\u201d If they have not been evolved by natural selection, I maintain that other and as equally potent agents as natural selection have been at work.

Had he taken the trouble to do so, he would have found a sufficient recognition of the general fact that instinctive habits not unfrequently serve to mitigate the swamping effects on incipient varieties of intercrossing with their parent forms. Moreover, he would have found that there are others of these habits mentioned by me which are probably much more effectual in this respect than is the one to which he draws attention.

In a gap on the title-page of one copy has been written \u201cauct. Mauricius de Prasse,\u201d apparently long ago, and in a German hand. But apart from this the last sentence of the first paragraph identifies the author as the writer of \u201cUsus logarithmorum,\u201d which bears the same Latin form of the name in print.","dc.creator":["COPELAND, RALPH"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["COPELAND, RALPH"],"citation_author_institution":["Lord Crawford's Observatory, Dun Echt"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"An Incorrect Footnote and its Consequences","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;An Incorrect Footnote and its Consequences&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"037416b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

To-day this dog has growing on the inner aspects of both its fore and hind feet, and situated some 9 centimetres above the soles, on each limb, a strong rudimentary toe. If we choose, say, this toe on the right hind foot as an example of them all, we find it to be loosely attached, rather more than a centimetre long to the base of the claw, which latter is large and strong, powerfully curved, and fully as big as any of the claws on the foot phalanges. I further find that this toe has a well-marked pad on its under side, but careful examination fails to detect any bone in the proximal joint, from which I also infer that the ungual phalanx likewise lacks one, though this is not so easily determined without cutting through the horny theca forming the claw. About four months ago this dog was coursing hares over the prairie of this region, which chances to be overgrown with a stiff growth of sage-brush, about 2 feet to 3 feet high. The wiry stems of this plant, as the dog bounded among them, snipped off all four of these rudimentary digits, close down to the leg in each case, as nicely as though it had been done with a knife, leaving linear wounds about half a centimetre long. Now, instead of the lips of these wounds healing across, as one would naturally suppose they would, they immediately form the basis, in each case, for the growth of another rudimentary clawed toe, fully as perfect as the one which originally sprang from the same site.

They are electrometers, which are divided directly into volts. The needle, which is made of aluminium, moves about a horizontal axis of hard steel, and is repelled from the vertical brass piece connected with the knob above. The instruments have the advantage that they are much easier of manipulation than the gold-leaf electroscope, while the sensibility is nearly the same, and fully suffices for all lecture purposes. Potentials are read off directly in volts, so that the measurements in the experiments on electrostatics and electrodynamics can all be referred to the same unit, whereby the conception of the student gains in distinctness, and the lecture in simplicity.

They are electrometers, which are divided directly into volts. The needle, which is made of aluminium, moves about a horizontal axis of hard steel, and is repelled from the vertical brass piece connected with the knob above. The instruments have the advantage that they are much easier of manipulation than the gold-leaf electroscope, while the sensibility is nearly the same, and fully suffices for all lecture purposes. Potentials are read off directly in volts, so that the measurements in the experiments on electrostatics and electrodynamics can all be referred to the same unit, whereby the conception of the student gains in distinctness, and the lecture in simplicity. In consequence of the specially careful workmanship, the needle adjusts itself quickly and with certainty, so that readings may be made to about 10 volts. The back and front consist of glass disks 1 mm. thick, each of which covers a plate of zinc of the same size, out of which are cut two equal and opposite slits, through which the position of the needle on the brass scale is read off.

How they steer, has never been fully explained. With the naked eye or, still better, with a field glass, many of them can be seen to use their tails, lowering the left or right side according to the direction in which they wish to go. This use of the tail as a rudder is much practised by pigeons, jackdaws, rooks, larks, swallows, housemartins, sandmartins, and I believe, by most of our common birds. Gulls let down a foot on one side or the other, and, no doubt, many other web-footed birds do the same. Still a rook or pigeon that has lost his tail manages to steer well, the chief result of the loss being that he cannot stop suddenly, nor float upon the air, but must take rapid strokes with his wings. What other method, then, has the bird of steering? One fact that bears upon this question can be easily observed. When a bird wishes to turn to the left he moves the centre of gravity of his body and flings himself on his left side, the right wing pointing upward and the left downward. How does he throw himself into this position? Most writers say that it is by striking harder with one wing than the other. In turning to the left the right wing would give a vigorous stroke, and so raise the right side of the body more than the left. At first sight it seems as if this explanation could not be the true one, since after a hard stroke the right wing should be lower than the left, which has only given a gentle one, and yet it is the right wing that is raised. But we must not be too hasty in drawing conclusions from this. When the down stroke takes place the wings do not descend far; the body rises so that the end of the wing appears to have described a much greater arc than it has done in reality. If, then, with the right wing a much harder stroke is given than with the left, the right side of the body will at once be raised, and the whole bird will be thrown upon its left side, while the movement of the wing itself may not be enough to be perceptible. If birds are watched as they fly, one wing seems always to be at the same angle to the body as the other, so that a straight line connecting the tips of the wings would pass through the two shoulder joints, or be parallel to a line passing through them. Instantaneous photographs of birds on the wing seem to me to bear this out. One wing may point up and the other down, but that is through the swaying of the whole body to one side or the other. In spite of this there may be an inequality of stroke that escapes detection, and without assuming this it seems on first thoughts difficult to account for the extraordinarily rapid turns made, for instance, by the swallow. But supposing that what appears to be the case is really so, viz., that equal force is put into both wings, there remains another possible explanation of this movement of the centre of gravity to the left or right in turning. If a bird wishes to steer leftwards, he may bend at the waist towards the left. So much has been said about the rigidity of the bird's backbone that its suppleness at a point just anterior to the ilium has been overlooked. I find that a swallow's vertebral column will bend at this point so as to form an angle of 150\u00b0, in the case of a kestrel it is 156\u00b0, of a tern 155\u00b0, of a sandmartin much the same as in the case of the swallow, in the case of a duck 165\u00b0; i.e. a duck can bend much less at the waist than the other birds mentioned, and you have only to watch ducks on the wing to see that they are very poor steerers. This is but meagre evidence, and, at present, I have not the means of collecting more. Still, as far as it goes, it seems to show that suppleness of waist goes along with the power of swerving rapidly, and, a priori, it seems extremely improbable that such a highly acrobatic feat should be performed without calling into play every power that is available. Direct observation can, I fear, afford little help, since the feathers obscure any slight bend in the back. But the habit that many birds have\u2014it can be easily seen in the case of gulls\u2014of turning their heads in the direction in which they wish to go, suggests that it may be by bending the vertebral column at a point where it would be more effective, that they make their turns, just as a skater changes edge and flies off on an opposite curve by swaying the weight of his shoulders across to one side or the other, a change of balance effected by a bend sideways at the waist. It is certain that birds do not depend entirely on movements of the head or neck, since gulls, for instance, may occasionally be seen to turn to the left while looking to the right and vice versa, a point which may be made out from instantaneous photographs.

How they steer, has never been fully explained. With the naked eye or, still better, with a field glass, many of them can be seen to use their tails, lowering the left or right side according to the direction in which they wish to go. This use of the tail as a rudder is much practised by pigeons, jackdaws, rooks, larks, swallows, housemartins, sandmartins, and I believe, by most of our common birds. Gulls let down a foot on one side or the other, and, no doubt, many other web-footed birds do the same. Still a rook or pigeon that has lost his tail manages to steer well, the chief result of the loss being that he cannot stop suddenly, nor float upon the air, but must take rapid strokes with his wings. What other method, then, has the bird of steering? One fact that bears upon this question can be easily observed. When a bird wishes to turn to the left he moves the centre of gravity of his body and flings himself on his left side, the right wing pointing upward and the left downward. How does he throw himself into this position? Most writers say that it is by striking harder with one wing than the other. In turning to the left the right wing would give a vigorous stroke, and so raise the right side of the body more than the left. At first sight it seems as if this explanation could not be the true one, since after a hard stroke the right wing should be lower than the left, which has only given a gentle one, and yet it is the right wing that is raised. But we must not be too hasty in drawing conclusions from this. When the down stroke takes place the wings do not descend far; the body rises so that the end of the wing appears to have described a much greater arc than it has done in reality. If, then, with the right wing a much harder stroke is given than with the left, the right side of the body will at once be raised, and the whole bird will be thrown upon its left side, while the movement of the wing itself may not be enough to be perceptible. If birds are watched as they fly, one wing seems always to be at the same angle to the body as the other, so that a straight line connecting the tips of the wings would pass through the two shoulder joints, or be parallel to a line passing through them. Instantaneous photographs of birds on the wing seem to me to bear this out. One wing may point up and the other down, but that is through the swaying of the whole body to one side or the other. In spite of this there may be an inequality of stroke that escapes detection, and without assuming this it seems on first thoughts difficult to account for the extraordinarily rapid turns made, for instance, by the swallow. But supposing that what appears to be the case is really so, viz., that equal force is put into both wings, there remains another possible explanation of this movement of the centre of gravity to the left or right in turning. If a bird wishes to steer leftwards, he may bend at the waist towards the left. So much has been said about the rigidity of the bird's backbone that its suppleness at a point just anterior to the ilium has been overlooked. I find that a swallow's vertebral column will bend at this point so as to form an angle of 150\u00b0, in the case of a kestrel it is 156\u00b0, of a tern 155\u00b0, of a sandmartin much the same as in the case of the swallow, in the case of a duck 165\u00b0; i.e. a duck can bend much less at the waist than the other birds mentioned, and you have only to watch ducks on the wing to see that they are very poor steerers. This is but meagre evidence, and, at present, I have not the means of collecting more. Still, as far as it goes, it seems to show that suppleness of waist goes along with the power of swerving rapidly, and, a priori, it seems extremely improbable that such a highly acrobatic feat should be performed without calling into play every power that is available. Direct observation can, I fear, afford little help, since the feathers obscure any slight bend in the back. But the habit that many birds have\u2014it can be easily seen in the case of gulls\u2014of turning their heads in the direction in which they wish to go, suggests that it may be by bending the vertebral column at a point where it would be more effective, that they make their turns, just as a skater changes edge and flies off on an opposite curve by swaying the weight of his shoulders across to one side or the other, a change of balance effected by a bend sideways at the waist. It is certain that birds do not depend entirely on movements of the head or neck, since gulls, for instance, may occasionally be seen to turn to the left while looking to the right and vice versa, a point which may be made out from instantaneous photographs. I cannot help thinking, then, that a bird avails itself of the suppleness of its waist to alter its balance when it wishes to turn. Whether this is the sole means, or whether at the same time the wings are worked unequally so as to conduce to the same end is difficult to decide. I may add that I have found the required muscles at the waist considerably developed.","dc.creator":["HEADLEY, F.

My memory also serves me sufficiently far back to remember a great variety of different \u201cstrains\u201d of Cineraria, in which they had not got so far away from the parent C. cruenta as they now are. I say the parent C. cruenta, because I believe that we have to deal with races or strains, obtained by selection according to the taste of the several selectors, and not with the descendants of hybrids between different species. I think Mr. Bateson has relied too implicity on the literature of the subject. Many of the records of hybrid productions in the vegetable kingdom are based upon groundless assumptions; mere seminal variations having been mistaken for crosses. It requires some skill and care to raise hybrids in the Composit\u00e6; and when you have raised your hybrid, even assuming a fertile one, you can only propagate it vegetatively. All stability is gone. But it is not so with selected seminal variations of a given species. They will intercross most freely, and give birth to new varieties without end; yet each one of those varieties may be reproduced from seed, by careful isolation, without a single \u201cbastard\u201d appearing. There are several instances among our cultivated plants of this great plasticity combined with stability, but I will give only one\u2014the China Aster. I select this because there can be no question of hybridity; and there is as great, or even a greater, variety than in the herbaceous Cinerarias. But with regard to the latter, I think our experience and the trustworthy literature go to prove that it is an analogous case. Careful selection, year after year, has resulted in the various fixed races or strains offered by florists.

As I had been informed with certainty by the late Prof. J. T.

So long ago as 1836 Prof. Dug\u00e8s described, under the name of Lumbricus phosphoreus, a worm which showed this peculiarity.

Giard named the species Photodrilus phosphoreus. It has been met with and noticed to be luminous by two other observers. Quite recently (Zoolog. Jahrb\u00fccher, xii., 1899, p. 216) Dr. Michaelsen, of Hamburg, ascertained that this species of Giard is really identical with Microscolex modestus of Rosa. The multiplication of names is hardly the fault of Prof. Giard, since the genus Microscolex had only been instituted a few months before his genus Photodrilus. This species, unlike the majority of its congeners, which are chiefly congregated in Patagonia, and there very abundant, is not only European, but also occurs in England.

JOHN PERRY has asked me to write something in criticism of the views he has lately expressed about the teaching of mathematics. I am inclined to ask, What is the use? He knows my views pretty well, and others too; and those who don't can learn them if they want to by buying my books. That is the best way, as it brings in one-and-threepences, and so does some good. I think there is a great deal to be said on both sides, and that if you are a born logic-chopper you will think differently from Faraday. The subject is too large, and I will only offer a few remarks about the teaching of geometry, based upon my own experience and observations. Euclid is the worst. It is shocking that young people should be addling their brains over mere logical subtleties, trying to understand the proof of one obvious fact in terms of something equally, or, it may be, not quite so obvious, and conceiving a profound dislike for mathematics, when they might be learning geometry, a most important fundamental subject, which can be made very interesting and instructive. I hold the view that it is essentially an experimental science, like any other, and should be taught observationally, descriptively and experimentally in the first place. The teaching should be a natural continuation of that education in geometry which every child undergoes by contact with his surroundings, only, of course, made definite and purposeful. It should be a teaching of the broad facts of geometry as they really exist, so as to impart an all-round knowledge of the subject It should be Solid as well as Plane; the sphere and cube, &c., as well as the usual circle and square; models, sections, diagrams, compasses, rulers, &c., every aid that is useful and practical should be given. And it should be quantitative as well. The value of \u03c0 should be measured; it may be done to a high degree of accuracy. So with the area of the circle, ellipse and all sorts of other things. The famous 47th. The boy who really measures and finds it true will have grasped the fact far better than by a logical demonstration without adequate experimental knowledge; for it happens that boys, who are generally very stupid in abstract ideas, learn a demonstration without knowing what it is all about in an intelligent manner. It may be said by logicians that you do not prove anything in this way. I differ. It might equally well be said that you prove nothing by any physical measurements. You have really proved the most important part. What a so-called rigorous proof amounts to is only this, that by limitation and substitution, arguing about abstract perfect circles, &c., replacing the practical ones, you can be as precise as you please. Now when a boy has learnt geometry, and has become competent to reason about its connections, he may pass on to the theory of the subject. Even then it should not be in Euclidean style; let the invaluable assistance of arithmetic and algebra be invoked, and the most useful idea of the vector be made prominent. I feel quite certain that I am right in this question of the teaching of geometry, having gone through it at school, where I made the closest observations on the effect of Euclid upon the rest of them. It was a sad farce, though conducted by a conscientious, hard-working teacher. Two or three followed, and were made temporarily into conceited logic-choppers, contradicting their parents; the effect upon most of the rest was disheartening and demoralising. I also feel quite certain about the experiential and experimental basis of space geometry, though that opinion has been of slow growth. If I understand them rightly, it is generally believed by mathematicians that geometry is pre-existent in the human mind, and that all we do is to look at nature and observe an approximate resemblance to the properties of the ideal space. You might assert the same preexistence of dynamics or chemistry. I think it is a complete reversal of the natural order of ideas. It seems to me that geometry is only pre-existent in this limited sense; that since we are the children of many fathers and mothers, all of whom grew up and developed their minds (so far as they went) in contact with nature, of which they were a part, so our brains have grown to suit. So the child takes in the facts of space geometry naturally and easily.

JOHN PERRY has asked me to write something in criticism of the views he has lately expressed about the teaching of mathematics. I am inclined to ask, What is the use? He knows my views pretty well, and others too; and those who don't can learn them if they want to by buying my books. That is the best way, as it brings in one-and-threepences, and so does some good. I think there is a great deal to be said on both sides, and that if you are a born logic-chopper you will think differently from Faraday. The subject is too large, and I will only offer a few remarks about the teaching of geometry, based upon my own experience and observations. Euclid is the worst. It is shocking that young people should be addling their brains over mere logical subtleties, trying to understand the proof of one obvious fact in terms of something equally, or, it may be, not quite so obvious, and conceiving a profound dislike for mathematics, when they might be learning geometry, a most important fundamental subject, which can be made very interesting and instructive. I hold the view that it is essentially an experimental science, like any other, and should be taught observationally, descriptively and experimentally in the first place. The teaching should be a natural continuation of that education in geometry which every child undergoes by contact with his surroundings, only, of course, made definite and purposeful. It should be a teaching of the broad facts of geometry as they really exist, so as to impart an all-round knowledge of the subject It should be Solid as well as Plane; the sphere and cube, &c., as well as the usual circle and square; models, sections, diagrams, compasses, rulers, &c., every aid that is useful and practical should be given. And it should be quantitative as well. The value of \u03c0 should be measured; it may be done to a high degree of accuracy. So with the area of the circle, ellipse and all sorts of other things. The famous 47th. The boy who really measures and finds it true will have grasped the fact far better than by a logical demonstration without adequate experimental knowledge; for it happens that boys, who are generally very stupid in abstract ideas, learn a demonstration without knowing what it is all about in an intelligent manner. It may be said by logicians that you do not prove anything in this way. I differ. It might equally well be said that you prove nothing by any physical measurements. You have really proved the most important part. What a so-called rigorous proof amounts to is only this, that by limitation and substitution, arguing about abstract perfect circles, &c., replacing the practical ones, you can be as precise as you please. Now when a boy has learnt geometry, and has become competent to reason about its connections, he may pass on to the theory of the subject. Even then it should not be in Euclidean style; let the invaluable assistance of arithmetic and algebra be invoked, and the most useful idea of the vector be made prominent. I feel quite certain that I am right in this question of the teaching of geometry, having gone through it at school, where I made the closest observations on the effect of Euclid upon the rest of them. It was a sad farce, though conducted by a conscientious, hard-working teacher. Two or three followed, and were made temporarily into conceited logic-choppers, contradicting their parents; the effect upon most of the rest was disheartening and demoralising. I also feel quite certain about the experiential and experimental basis of space geometry, though that opinion has been of slow growth. If I understand them rightly, it is generally believed by mathematicians that geometry is pre-existent in the human mind, and that all we do is to look at nature and observe an approximate resemblance to the properties of the ideal space. You might assert the same preexistence of dynamics or chemistry. I think it is a complete reversal of the natural order of ideas. It seems to me that geometry is only pre-existent in this limited sense; that since we are the children of many fathers and mothers, all of whom grew up and developed their minds (so far as they went) in contact with nature, of which they were a part, so our brains have grown to suit. So the child takes in the facts of space geometry naturally and easily. The experience of past generations makes the acquisition of present experience easier, and so it comes about that we cannot help seeing it. But it is all experience, after all; although learned philosophers, by long, long thinking over the theory of groups and other abstruse high developments, may perhaps come to what I think is a sort of self-deception, and think that their geometry is pre-existent in themselves, whilst nature's is only a bad copy.

We had reached a height of about 4000 feet above sea level when we saw the very remarkable halo of which I send you the photograph of the copy of a very careful drawing, made on the spot. I first caught site of the halo at 11.30 a.m., on lying down for a short rest on a large flat horizontal stone, but I have no reason to doubt that it had been visible for some time before. The early morning had been brilliantly fine, the air still, and the sun very hot; about 10.30 a.m. a very light breeze from almost due south began to blow, with intervals of dead calm. When the halo was seen, the sky was completely covered with a thin white haze. There was, however, no rain that day, though the weather on the next and succeeding days was not good. The sky outside the circles seemed everywhere brighter than inside them; the sun shone through the haze scarcely brightly enough to throw a distinct shadow, and his rays aroused no sensation of warmth. The inner edge of all the rings was fairly sharp, and of an orange-red colour, brightening into yellow, which grew paler towards the outer rim, where it faded into a bluish-white radiance, which in turn became imperceptibly blended with the white misty sky. The width of the rings was from one-and-a-half to two degrees.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"66","prism.number":"1699","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"76","prism.endingPage":"77","prism.copyright":"1902 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/066076c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/066076c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/066076c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/066076c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"A Remarkable Solar Halo","citation_volume":"66","citation_issue":"1699","citation_publication_date":"1902/05","citation_firstpage":"76","citation_lastpage":"77","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/066076c0","DOI":"10.1038/066076c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/066076c0","description":"ON Sunday, August 7, 1898, being in Norway, I was climbing, with a friend, the upper slopes of the Horntind, above Skogstad, in the well-known Valders route between Christiania and L\u00e6rdal, lat. 61\u00b0 15\u2032 30\u2033, long. exactly 6\u00b0 E.

J. J. THOMSON'S interesting article in last week's NATURE raises the question of how long the emission of energy by radium may be expected to continue. I think in this connection that it would be of great importance to determine, if possible, whether radium, as contained in pitchblende, emits as much energy as the same amount of the material in the form of an artificially concentrated product. The mineral must be supposed to have been in existence, in its present condition, for a period of time comparable with the age of the earth\u2014perhaps 50 million years.

J. J. THOMSON'S interesting article in last week's NATURE raises the question of how long the emission of energy by radium may be expected to continue. I think in this connection that it would be of great importance to determine, if possible, whether radium, as contained in pitchblende, emits as much energy as the same amount of the material in the form of an artificially concentrated product. The mineral must be supposed to have been in existence, in its present condition, for a period of time comparable with the age of the earth\u2014perhaps 50 million years. It is certainly more likely to have lost than gained activity during that time. We may therefore reasonably assume that it has been liberating energy at not less than its present rate for 50 million years. A determination of the amount of energy thus emitted would carry us much further than the most careful and protracted observations on powerful radium preparations.","dc.creator":["STRUTT, R.

The proposition that the \u201cFaraday tube\u201d may be subdivided would appear to be capable of being widely applied in connection with many of the most interesting phenomena of chemistry. Thus not only would the existence of water of crystallisation and the formation of so-called molecular compounds be thereby brought into line with the more typical manifestations of valency, as pointed out in Sir Oliver's letter, but it would appear that it may possibly enable the hitherto conflicting hydrate and dissociation theories of solution to be harmonised. Thus in the case of an electrolyte such as sodium chloride, we should in the dry state regard the sodium atom united to the chlorine atom by means of a Faraday tube or bundle, as it may more appropriately be designated, the union leading to the great stability of the compound as such. On the addition of water, however, some of the constituent fibres or strands of the bundle become deflected in such a way that the sodium and chlorine atoms become respectively combined with water. With sufficient water present the original union between the sodium and chlorine atoms will become entirely severed, the Faraday bundle starting with its positive extremity on the sodium atom will terminate at its negative end by means of a plurality of strands on a number of water molecules, and similarly the Faraday bundle emanating by its negative extremity from the chlorine atom will terminate at its positive end in a plurality of strands also on a number of water molecules. In such a solution we should thus have independence of the sodium and chlorine atoms, or the phenomenon of ionisation. In such a solution, moreover, the union between sodium and chlorine would be entirely abolished through the complete diversion of the strands of the Faraday bundle formerly uniting them, whilst the union between the oxygen and hydrogen of the water molecules would be but slightly weakened owing to only a small fraction of the total number of strands in the bundles uniting the oxygen and hydrogen in each molecule being diverted by the sodium and the chlorine. The dissociation into its ions of an electrolyte on solution in water would thus be the consequence of the antecedent hydration of the ions.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"70","prism.number":"1810","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"222","prism.endingPage":"223","prism.copyright":"1904 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/070222e0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/070222e0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/070222e0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/070222e0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Residual Affinity","citation_volume":"70","citation_issue":"1810","citation_publication_date":"1904/07","citation_firstpage":"222","citation_lastpage":"223","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/070222e0","DOI":"10.1038/070222e0","citation_doi":"10.1038/070222e0","description":"SIR OLIVER LODGE'S highly suggestive letter (June 23, p. 176) will be welcome to the many chemists who have been endeavouring to interpret chemical phenomena in terms of the electronic theory of the physicist. The proposition that the \u201cFaraday tube\u201d may be subdivided would appear to be capable of being widely applied in connection with many of the most interesting phenomena of chemistry.

Usually when a magnetic element during a storm suffers a large deviation in one direction it does not simply return to, but overshoots, its original value, and oscillates about its undisturbed position. If we liken the curve to the outline of an island on a map, a conspicuous indentation of the coast line is usually accompanied by a correspondingly pronounced promontory. Whilst this is much the more common phenomenon, it is by no means very unusual to have, as it were, an isolated bay in an otherwise straight coast line; only when this happens the \u201cbay\u201d seldom forms a deep indentation, and the curvature of its outline is seldom very great. On November 15, during the recent display of aurora, a somewhat remarkable instance of a nearly isolated \u201cbay\u201d presented itself in the declination curve trace at Kew. Taking, again, the geographical analogy, it resembles\u2014as may be seen from the accompanying copy of the curve1\u2014a regular estuary. We have, commencing at 8.53 p.m., an easterly movement, which in twelve minutes reduced the declination about 32\u2032, while in the subsequent twenty minutes the declination increased 34\u2032, thus returning very nearly to the value it had half an hour before. This was by no means the only movement during the magnetic storm of November 15, but it was far and away the most conspicuous one. Its remarkable form would predispose one to attribute it to some very special cause, which one would naturally associate with the coexisting aurora. Curiously, however, a very similar movement was experienced three days earlier, when no special auroral display seems to have been noted in this country, the intervening days being free from any large disturbance. This earlier disturbance\u2014a copy of which is also shown\u2014took place on November 12, also in the evening, but nearly 21/2 hours earlier than that on November 15. The conspicuous movement on November 12 began about 6.30 p.m. The easterly movement was fully larger than on November 15, being about 35\u2032.5 while the return swing to the west was about 36\u2032.5.

I showed that, both developmentally and structurally, there was every reason to doubt whether the renal cardinal meshwork takes any part in the formation of the plexus of blood-vessels which surrounds the urinary tubules (although, of course, these are connected with each other), and that therefore the blood apparently supplied to the kidney by the \u201crenal-portal\u201d (post-renal) vein is in all probability not utilised in the production of the kidney secretion. This conclusion, opposed to that held by most physiologists and morphologists, I supported by citing the physiological experiments of Nussbaum (Pfluger's Archiv, xvi., xvii., 1878; Anat. Anzeig., i., 1886) and Beddard (Jour. Physiol., xxviii., 1902), which afforded valuable confirmation. These experiments, as is well known, proved that after the arterial supply of the frog's kidney had been eliminated all secretion immediately stopped, notwithstanding the facts that the \u201crenal-portal\u201d circulation was still in full swing and that powerful diuretics were employed. The sole objection to regarding these experiments as conclusive was that, in consequence of the kidney being deprived of oxygenated blood, the tubular epithelium had degenerated, and was therefore not in a condition to secrete.

I was travelling along the London to Oxford road at the time, and when passing through Stokenchurch (seventeen miles from Oxford) was suddenly aware of a pale green light of sufficient intensity to be quite noticeable even when looking down at the road. On looking up I saw the meteor just as it disappeared. It presented the appearance of a luminous green ball of about one-quarter the sun's diameter, though this can only be regarded as quite an approximate estimate. My first impression was that the phenomenon was an unusual type of meteor, but on account of the brilliant green colour I immediately afterwards came to the conclusion that it must have been a rocket, and therefore did not unfortunately note the exact time or careful particulars as to the position.

I was travelling along the London to Oxford road at the time, and when passing through Stokenchurch (seventeen miles from Oxford) was suddenly aware of a pale green light of sufficient intensity to be quite noticeable even when looking down at the road. On looking up I saw the meteor just as it disappeared. It presented the appearance of a luminous green ball of about one-quarter the sun's diameter, though this can only be regarded as quite an approximate estimate. My first impression was that the phenomenon was an unusual type of meteor, but on account of the brilliant green colour I immediately afterwards came to the conclusion that it must have been a rocket, and therefore did not unfortunately note the exact time or careful particulars as to the position. I should estimate that the meteor lay about N.N.E. when I saw it, but that the altitude was somewhat greater than the 17\u00b0 given by Dr. Rambaut. The agreement in time and place was, however, sufficiently close to leave no doubt that it must have been the same phenomenon.

Only recently have DNA sequencing and analytical techniques converged to make this possible. Important advances have come from comparing genetic variation within species (polymorphism) with fixed differences between species (divergence)1,2.

Recently, the use of coding metamaterials has been suggested for the control of electromagnetic waves through the design of coding sequences using digital elements \u20180\u2019 and \u20181,' which possess opposite phase responses. Here we propose the concept of an anisotropic coding metamaterial in which the coding behaviors in different directions are dependent on the polarization status of the electromagnetic waves. We experimentally demonstrate an ultrathin and flexible polarization-controlled anisotropic coding metasurface that functions in the terahertz regime using specially designed coding elements. By encoding the elements with elaborately designed coding sequences (both 1-bit and 2-bit sequences), the x- and y-polarized waves can be anomalously reflected or independently diffused in three dimensions. The simulated far-field scattering patterns and near-field distributions are presented to illustrate the dual-functional performance of the encoded metasurface, and the results are consistent with the measured results. We further demonstrate the ability of the anisotropic coding metasurfaces to generate a beam splitter and realize simultaneous anomalous reflections and polarization conversions, thus providing powerful control of differently polarized electromagnetic waves. The proposed method enables versatile beam behaviors under orthogonal polarizations using a single metasurface and has the potential for use in the development of interesting terahertz devices. An artificial material that controls electromagnetic waves of different polarization independently has been demonstrated by a team in China. Tie Jun Cui from the Southeast University and co-workers have created a metamaterial that can, for example, split incoming unpolarized radiation so that horizontally polarized light goes one way while vertically polarized light goes the other. Metamaterials are structures that can be engineered to have optical properties not found in natural materials, and they consist of a repeated pattern of elements that are smaller than the wavelength of light. The researchers used two types of element, simple squares and dumbbells, which enabled them to independently control beams of long-wavelength radiation known as terahertz waves having differing polarizations.

A definitive analysis of the discontinuity will have to await more data because of the normally irregular behaviour of the period3.","dc.creator":["REICHLEY, P. E.","DOWNS, G.
