The writer says, \u201cThe phenomenon known as \u00abSunstroke\u2019 is due to the action of light, and not, as is generally believed, to the elevation of temperature.\u201d An exception has to be made in cases where the sun playing, especially on the back of the head and neck, produces unmistakeable sunstroke. Every surgeon practising in the East also meets instances of \u201csolar apoplexy,\u201d which present themselves as often as not during the night, but only in the excessively hot weather.

The writer says, \u201cThe phenomenon known as \u00abSunstroke\u2019 is due to the action of light, and not, as is generally believed, to the elevation of temperature.\u201d An exception has to be made in cases where the sun playing, especially on the back of the head and neck, produces unmistakeable sunstroke. Every surgeon practising in the East also meets instances of \u201csolar apoplexy,\u201d which present themselves as often as not during the night, but only in the excessively hot weather. However, I know from personal experience that it is quite possible to lay oneself up completely with intense headache, constant nausea, cold extremities, &c., by exposing the eyes only to the glare of the sun, the head and neck being completely sheltered by a helmet and puggree, and the body being at rest in a carriage.

M. J. Berkeley will exonerate me from any deliberate intention to misrepresent him; nor do I think that there is, after all, much difference of opinion between us regarding the present subject, unless, perhaps, that I am more sceptical. I alluded to the paper cited by him from the \u201cJournal of the Horticultural Society,\u201d on propagation of bunt spores, and not to his communications on the hop or vine mildew. I was under the impression that he regarded the \u201cfour consecutive forms of reproductive cells in the bunt\u201d as an instance of alternation of generations. On reference to the original paper, I find that he did not go so far then as to indicate four consecutive forms of reproductive cells; but that Tulasne followed on his track in 1854, and in 1857 Mr. Berkeley seemed to have accepted the results of Tulasne's observations, since, in his \u201cIntroduction,\u201d he gives figures at page 318, in the description of which the following phrases occur:\u2014\u201cspores of the second order,\u201d \u201cspores of the third order,\u201d \u201cspores of the fourth order.\u201d Here are the \u201cfour consecutive forms of reproductive cells\u201d to which I alluded. At page 321 he writes concerning the bunt:\u2014\u201cThe spores, however, are not immediate means of propagation; they are, in fact, only a sort of prothallus, from which the mycelium grows, producing at the tips, or on lateral branchlets, bodies of various forms, which are themselves capable of germination, and immediately reproduce the species.\u201d The real issue between us seems to lie in the phrase, \u201calternation of generations.\u201d If the bunt spores, on germination, produce fusiform bodies, which, after conjugation, produce short cylindrical spores, and thus intermediate reproductive cells unlike the parent cell come between that and the ultimate reproduction of the species, I am induced to call it an \u201calternation of generations.\u201d It would be waste of time to discuss phrases, or I might take exception to the application of this phrase to the Erysiphei. The conidia and pycnidia of the hop mildew may be developed without sporangial conceptacles, and the parasite reproduced without sporangial fruit, but I cannot recognise alternation of generations in the reproduction of a species by means of conidia, stylospores, or sporidia, or by one of these alone. If such may be construed into an alternation of generations, it must be by permitting greater elasticity to the phrase. Conidia germinating and producing pycnidia, the stylospores of the pycnidia germinating and producing sporangial conceptacles, containing the sporidia which, upon germination, will produce the mycelium and conidia again, returning to the original form after two or three consecutive departures from it, appears to me a perfect type of alternation of generations. I fully admit that \u201cif it is once established that a Puccinia produces an \u00c6cidium, or an \u00c6cidium a Puccinia, we should have a clear case, especially when the third form reverts to the first again.\u201d Without the slightest desire to \u201cdepreciate the labours of Oersted and De Bary,\u201d I cannot admit that they have established facts until their observations are confirmed, especially when there is an evident possibility of their having been deceived.

It was not, perhaps, an unreasonable inference, therefore, to draw from the terms of the notice, that it was the intention of the College to make Biology in its widest sense the foundation of the examination, and to allow individual candidates to exhibit, in addition, such detailed knowledge as they might possess of Zoology, Botany, or even Pal\u00e6ontology.

I fully agree with him that there is not a particle of evidence for their Laurentian age, and that their syenites and hornblendic granites cannot be correlated with the hornblendic gneiss of the Malverns, but I must demur to his grouping them with the Cambrian rocks of the Longmynds or of Llanberis. The authority of Prof. Sedgwick is great, but it must be remembered that the term Cambrian with him included far more than in the nomenclature of the Geological Survey, and I am not aware that he ever committed himself to the Charnwood rocks being equivalent to his Lower Cambrians. Except a slight lithological resemblance of some Charnwood rocks to those of Harlech and Llanberis, and a still slighter to Longmynd rocks, there is really nothing in favour of this special correlation. One point, however, there is which may give some clue to their age, which does not seem to have been much noticed hitherto, probably because the facts have been strangely overlooked in the Geological Survey description of the district. It is that beds of coarse volcanic agglomerate and ash abound among the Charnwood series. Further, the resemblance of the rocks as a whole (when not unusually metamorphosed) is very close to the \u201cgreen slate and porphyry series\u201d (or Borrowdale rocks) of the Lake District. Compared with the Welsh rocks, they are far more like those of Cader-Idris than of Llanberis. With these there is scarce any lithological resemblance, but if I mixed my Charnwood collection with those from the other two localities, especially the former, I should have great difficulty in separating many specimens. It seems then to me far more likely that this great volcanic activity in the Charnwood district should have corresponded in time with that in the Lake District or with some part of that in Wales, than that it should have happened in the age of the Harlech, Llanberis, and Longmynd groups, where we have no evidence of any volcanic disturbance. The argument may be summed up thus, as it seems to me:\u2014The Charnwood rocks are old, so are both the competing groups; they are unfossiliferous, so are both; they are cleaved, so are both; they contain evidence of great volcanic action, so do the Borrowdale series, and not the Welsh Lower Cambrians.

In his case the success of the experiment was so marked that, according to his own statement, it \u201cmade life another thing.\u201d It would be interesting to know whether such a peculiarity was transmitted.","dc.creator":["CECIL, HENRY"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["CECIL, HENRY"],"citation_author_institution":["Bregner, Bournemouth"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Sense Perception of Electricity","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Sense Perception of Electricity&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"016550a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

M. Arismendi (now Consul of Venezuela, in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad) in this city, had a rather narrow escape from being set on fire by the spontaneous combustion of a large wasps' nest (a species of Polistes) in a closet under a roof. The day was exceedingly hot; but this circumstance, I think, has a very slight connection (if any at all) with the outbreak of smoke from the nest. Roofs in this country are constructed of tiles supported by a thick layer of compact earth, which rests on the usual lath-work of dry canes (the stems of Gynerium saccharoides, or arborescent grass), both being substances that conduct heat very badly.

M. Arismendi (now Consul of Venezuela, in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad) in this city, had a rather narrow escape from being set on fire by the spontaneous combustion of a large wasps' nest (a species of Polistes) in a closet under a roof. The day was exceedingly hot; but this circumstance, I think, has a very slight connection (if any at all) with the outbreak of smoke from the nest. Roofs in this country are constructed of tiles supported by a thick layer of compact earth, which rests on the usual lath-work of dry canes (the stems of Gynerium saccharoides, or arborescent grass), both being substances that conduct heat very badly. The source of heat must therefore have been in the nest itself. In bees-hives the temperature rises sometimes as high as 38\u00b0 C.

The first was captured in my presence in the Gulf of Genoa, in July last, from a depth of about 900 metres, the second I received from Nice, where it was captured in deep waters on September 1 last, and I know of a third specimen taken at the latter place.

For showing the popular class-room experiment of burning phosphorus in oxygen, I was in the habit of using a little cup of chalk made deeper and with smaller rim than the brass cups usually made for the purpose. The object of this was to limit the too rapid outburst of combustion. I noticed that a cup which had been used several times was coated on the inside with a hard, glassy enamel, which I supposed to be phosphate of lime. To test this, the cup was thrown into some hydrochloric acid and dissolved bodily, but I found at the bottom of the beaker an insoluble residue of crystalline particles. What were these? Could it be possible that the carbonic acid driven off by heating the chalk had, on reaching the heated phosphorus, become dissociated, its oxygen combining with the phosphorus, and its carbon thrown down as veritable diamond? To test this startling theory, I collected the particles and rubbed them between a glass pestle and mortar. They appeared hard enough to scratch the glass, but were too small for further examination. To obtain a better supply, I dissolved some phosphorus in bisulphide of carbon, pounded some chalk and made it into a paste with the solution, then filled a porcelain crucible with this and fired the mass by heating it over a Bunsen burner. It blazed magnificently, throwing out eruptive jets of flame. Here, in the absence of surrounding oxygen, the carbonic acid had every opportunity of becoming dissociated or reduced by the heated phosphorus. The residue was treated with hydrochloric acid, and this time I found at the bottom of the beaker quite a respectable quantity of crystalline grains. These left unmistakable scratches on the glass pestle and mortar, and seemed to make some fine scratches on an agate pestle and mortar. I next examined them under a microscope, and found that they were more like pebbles than crystals, so much so as to suggest another theory of their composition and origin, viz., that they were miniature chalk flints formed by the fusion and aggregation of the siliceous cuticles of fossil diatoms, or such-like organisms of which chalk appears to be in some degree made up.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"21","prism.number":"532","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"224","prism.endingPage":"225","prism.copyright":"1880 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/021224b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/021224b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/021224b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/021224b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Artificial Diamonds","citation_volume":"21","citation_issue":"532","citation_publication_date":"1880/01","citation_firstpage":"224","citation_lastpage":"225","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/021224b0","DOI":"10.1038/021224b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/021224b0","description":"THE fate of the Glasgow diamonds, as recorded in NATURE, vol. xxi. p. 203, reminds me of an adventure of my own that happened about ten years ago, and is likely to be repeated by others.

Higgin, F.L.S., and your correspondent Mr. Ward, I have just been examining the subsidences that have been lately taking place in the neighbourhood of Northwich. To understand how they occur, it is necessary to know that there are two beds of rock salt in the Triassic marl. The upper bed, 25 yards thick, is from 40 to 60 yards below the surface; the lower, 35 yards thick, is separated from the upper by about 10 yards of hard marl. The greater bulk of the salt is obtained in the form of brine pumped up from the upper bed. The lower bed is to a smaller extent worked as a salt-mine. From these operations two classes of subsidences result: the one general and gradual, due to the removal in solution of the rock salt of the upper bed by percolation of water and pumping, by which the surface of the ground sinks in undulations; the other, sudden fallings in of the ground into the mines, forming crater-like pits.

The problem to account for is how such an inverted cone of marl capped with boulder-clay and drift-sand could apparently have disappeared through so small a hole? The explanation appears to be this: By percolation of water the roof of the mine begins locally to give way and fall into the mine, gradually working its way to the surface, where it first appears in the form of a hole about the size of a well. The vacuity will no doubt take a conical form, the base being at the roof of the mine; once the hole is formed, the surface-ground begins to slip and fall in around, gradually enlarging the orifice, the material disappearing into the mine below. This continues until the bottom is filled up and the sides of the \u201ccrater\u201d attain the angle of repose. The whole thing will occur in a night.

So far as we have been able to see the most perfect vacuum that I have been able to obtain with the Sprengel pump has behaved as to frictional electricity precisely as a perfect conductor such as water.","dc.creator":["BOTTOMLEY, J.

A. W. BENNETT'S paper (NATURE, vol. xxiv. p. 501) on the \u201cConstancy of Insects in Visiting Flowers\u201d recalls a note I made at Cromer during the hot weather of last July. On the cliffs west of that town, where flowers were very abundant and of various colours, I carefully watched the movements of a small tortoiseshell butterfly to ascertain what flowers it visited. It was at first busy with bindweed; then it left this for yellow bedstraw (Galium verum), returning presently to bindweed.

A. W. BENNETT'S paper (NATURE, vol. xxiv. p. 501) on the \u201cConstancy of Insects in Visiting Flowers\u201d recalls a note I made at Cromer during the hot weather of last July. On the cliffs west of that town, where flowers were very abundant and of various colours, I carefully watched the movements of a small tortoiseshell butterfly to ascertain what flowers it visited. It was at first busy with bindweed; then it left this for yellow bedstraw (Galium verum), returning presently to bindweed. Then it tried a thistle, which detained it some time, after which it shifted to ragwort, and finally revisited bindweed. It seemed equally busy with all these flowers, though so various in form and colour.

Looking up hastily, a bright meteor was seen moving rapidly in the north-eastern heavens; it started about 3\u00b0 north of Capella, and traversed a path of some 10\u00b0 in a north-easterly direction, passing about 2\u00b0 above (or west of) \u03b4Aurig\u00e6. Its flight did not exceed three seconds, when it burst with a dazzling brilliancy to be compared only to the whiteness of the electric light. At the moment of bursting, it must have been at least five or six times as bright as Venus at her maximum. It left in its wake, covering the full length of its path, a thin, reddish train, which drifted slowly toward the north-east among the stars, gradually collecting into a lightish cloud at its north-east end. Noting the remarkable permanency of the train, I turned the telescope (a 5 inch refractor) upon it, and was surprised to see a brightly-glowing mass of pinkish smoke.

The whole of this drifted north-easterly over the stars, curling slowly like a mighty serpent; it was knotted in places with cumulus forms, probably due to minor explosions in the meteor.

Could the vegetable accumulations from which the coal has resulted have escaped destruction if, during their subsidence, the world was subject to such tides as Mr. Ball postulates? It is difficult to understand how this could be if the shales and sandstones which overlie the coal be of marine or estuarine origin. Second. What do the Pal\u00e6ozoic conglomerates disclose on the subject? The shingle of beaches heaped up by the tide, having each layer of sand and pebble laid at the slope of the beach face, exhibits when cut at right angles to the trend of the beach the continuously oblique bedding which represents this slope, the vertical heights of the shingle bed thus laid up representing the extreme rise and fall of the tide and surges. This may be seen in the case of the Lower Eocene shingle in Bickley Cutting of the Dover Railway and in the case of the early Glacial shingle in deep pits at Henham and Halesworth in Suffolk. The latter show a tidal rise and fall there of more than twenty-five feet, the former not so much.

Could the vegetable accumulations from which the coal has resulted have escaped destruction if, during their subsidence, the world was subject to such tides as Mr. Ball postulates? It is difficult to understand how this could be if the shales and sandstones which overlie the coal be of marine or estuarine origin. Second. What do the Pal\u00e6ozoic conglomerates disclose on the subject? The shingle of beaches heaped up by the tide, having each layer of sand and pebble laid at the slope of the beach face, exhibits when cut at right angles to the trend of the beach the continuously oblique bedding which represents this slope, the vertical heights of the shingle bed thus laid up representing the extreme rise and fall of the tide and surges. This may be seen in the case of the Lower Eocene shingle in Bickley Cutting of the Dover Railway and in the case of the early Glacial shingle in deep pits at Henham and Halesworth in Suffolk. The latter show a tidal rise and fall there of more than twenty-five feet, the former not so much. The same structure obtains in the case of sandbanks left dry by the tide, and of such nearly all the Red Crag consists, the oblique layers of sand and shell corresponding to the oblique layers of sand and shingle in beaches. I have seen this structure extending for some distance in a railway cutting through Jurassic sandstone, but there was nothing to indicate that the tidal slope under which it was formed was greater than in the case of the Crag.

The effects of both are to be seen in the faces of two mountains a mile apart.

May I be permitted, however, from an otologist's point of view, to draw attention to a possible source of error in conducting researches of this kind when deductions are made, as they were in this instance, from acoustic experiments mainly? I allude to Mr. Tail's method of determining the hearing power of the animal experimented on, namely, his cat, \u201cOld Pudge,\u201d and the conclusions that he has drawn from the results obtained; thus he infers that purely \u201ctympanic\u201d deafness, consisting in an entire failure of the transmitting mechanism of the middle ear to respond to a\u00ebrial undulations of sound, existed in the case of \u201cOld Pudge,\u201d because the concussion produced by stamping on the floor could be heard by that animal, whilst the voice was not heard. Abnormal hearing of this kind, I am convinced, by no means establishes the fact that inner ear trouble does not exist, since such deaf-mutes as are believed to be defective in this regard are very sensitive to grave or deep tones\u2014thunder, for example, being painful even to them. Pudge's cochlear (inner ear) functions were believed to be serviceable, inasmuch as he could use his voice; but such evidence cannot be accepted as conclusive, for absolutely deaf persons, who have been deprived of both \u201ctympanic\u201c and \u201ccochlear\u201d functions, are yet capable of making noises, and often of learning to speak after a fashion. Another point is also of interest in this connection: the ears of Pudge, it is said, were found to be normal in every respect, both as to their transmitting and perceptive functions, with the exception of the absence of a triangular gap from either tympanic membrane. In reference to this it may he said, in the first place, that it is difficult to understand how the delicate mucous membrane lining the tympanum retained, its \u201cnormal\u201d condition under such exposure; and, in the second place, these defects could scarcely be the cause of absolute deafness, since it is a well-known fact that quite good hearing often remains in the human subject where, from disease, much greater loss in the tympanic membrane has been sustained than was found to exist in the hearing organs of Pudge. Altogether it seems probable that in certain white cats great congenital deafness may exist, and that the animal, on finding a\u00e4rial transmission of sound to be imperfect, comes finally, like man under similar circumstances, to disregard its use entirely, and place its reliance solely on sound that can be felt, as it were. Moreover, is it not probable also that the trouble, in some degree at least, may lie in the perceptive centre of the brain? It is a significant fact that in Pudge at least some disease of the nervous centres existed, since he was the subject of epileptic convulsions.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"29","prism.number":"744","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"312","prism.endingPage":"312","prism.copyright":"1884 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029312a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/029312a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029312a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029312a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Deafness in White Cats","citation_volume":"29","citation_issue":"744","citation_publication_date":"1884/01","citation_firstpage":"312","citation_lastpage":"312","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/029312a0","DOI":"10.1038/029312a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/029312a0","description":"THIS subject has been of much interest to me, and otologists as well as evolutionists must feel indebted to your contributor in NATURE of December 13, Mr. Lawson Tail, for his efforts to determine the cause.

In reference to this it may he said, in the first place, that it is difficult to understand how the delicate mucous membrane lining the tympanum retained, its \u201cnormal\u201d condition under such exposure; and, in the second place, these defects could scarcely be the cause of absolute deafness, since it is a well-known fact that quite good hearing often remains in the human subject where, from disease, much greater loss in the tympanic membrane has been sustained than was found to exist in the hearing organs of Pudge. Altogether it seems probable that in certain white cats great congenital deafness may exist, and that the animal, on finding a\u00e4rial transmission of sound to be imperfect, comes finally, like man under similar circumstances, to disregard its use entirely, and place its reliance solely on sound that can be felt, as it were. Moreover, is it not probable also that the trouble, in some degree at least, may lie in the perceptive centre of the brain? It is a significant fact that in Pudge at least some disease of the nervous centres existed, since he was the subject of epileptic convulsions.","dc.creator":["SEXTON, SAMUEL"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["SEXTON, SAMUEL"],"citation_author_institution":["New York"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Deafness in White Cats","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Deafness in White Cats&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"029334b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

These two are the only lighthouses at which any damage has been done; while those stations at which the tables are in operation have never suffered at all, although they have been repeatedly subjected to shocks.","dc.creator":["STEVENSON, CHARLES A."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["STEVENSON, CHARLES A."],"citation_author_institution":["Edinburgh"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Aseismatic Tables for Mitigating Earthquake...","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Aseismatic Tables for Mitigating Earthquake Shocks&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"030312d0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The length of the arc was not measured, but appeared to be nearly or quite 90\u00b0. The most of the halo was of a bright yellow colour, but not far from the middle of the arc was a spot of green separated on each side from the yellow arcs by a short neutral tract. The green spot was nearly round, and its breadth (as measured from the sun) was nearly the same as that of the yellow arcs, and the angular distances from the sun of both the yellow and green arcs were approximately equal. Iridescent halos are seen here every year, usually as complete circles about the sun, and often showing all or several of the prismatic colours, each forming its own definite ring at different distances from the sun. Such halos appear through a thick haze, or quite thin cloud.

The length of the arc was not measured, but appeared to be nearly or quite 90\u00b0. The most of the halo was of a bright yellow colour, but not far from the middle of the arc was a spot of green separated on each side from the yellow arcs by a short neutral tract. The green spot was nearly round, and its breadth (as measured from the sun) was nearly the same as that of the yellow arcs, and the angular distances from the sun of both the yellow and green arcs were approximately equal. Iridescent halos are seen here every year, usually as complete circles about the sun, and often showing all or several of the prismatic colours, each forming its own definite ring at different distances from the sun. Such halos appear through a thick haze, or quite thin cloud. This variegated halo appeared through a cloud so dense that the position of the sun could barely be made out by the eye, and it was of very variable density. The borders of the coloured arcs were not clearly defined, and apparently the light had been somewhat scattered by reflection upon the lower cloud particles.

My friend Mr. T. Hick, Botanical Lecturer at Owens College, showed me, some years ago, beautiful preparations of moulds stained with this substance, and I have frequently used it for the same purpose, as also chinoline-blue, known as \u201cblue No. 13\u201d of the aniline dyes. It is impossible to keep an aqueous solution of the latter for any length of time free from fungoid growth, the hyph\u00e6 of which, at a certain stage of development, exactly resemble the forms described by Messrs.

Remembering the very varied appearances assumed by the barren hyph\u00e6 of fungi, depending on nature of substratum, relative amount of moisture, &c., I believe that morphological agreement of vegetative parts by no means proves specific identity, even when both can be examined in a fresh, state\u2014a great advantage, as the chemical and physical properties of the hyph\u00e6 can be compared; but an expression of opinion as to relationship based on the comparison of barren hyphse with drawings is simply valueless, and only proves a very slender acquaintance with the characters of admitted specific value in the determination of fungi. Members of the Chytridiace\u00e6 are common only in books; during years of practical mycological work I have only once met with a species belonging to this group, and this one I could not succeed in staining with either methylene or chinoline-blue, but Bismarck-brown gave good results. I was inclined to attach a certain amount of value to this selective power exercised by fungi in connection with dyes, until I discovered that the hyphge producing the zygospores of Syzygites megalocarpa could not be stained with blue, but readily with methyl-green, while the hyphse of the conidial stage (grown by us from the zygospore) readily absorbed methylene-blue, but had no affinity for green.

W. Backhouse, I would suggest that he should use the spectroscope in the following manner. Hold it between the luminous object (moon or street lamp) and the eye at a distance of about 12 or 15 inches from the latter, so that only part of the spectrum is seen.

They may look on horticulture in the light of a pleasant pastime, or of a more or less profitable commercial enterprise, they may regard flower-shows as a means for the display of fashionably-dressed ladies, or they may look on the Royal Horticultural Society as an association for the production and distribution of medals and certificates of more commercial than scientific importance. But there are other considerations beyond these, and whilst naturalists may be indifferent to much of the past history and much of the present work of the Society, to the internal dissensions and to the action of the landlord Commissioners towards their unfortunate tenants, the scientific work of the Society may well excite their sympathy. A moment's consideration will show that the progress of horticulture is largely based on the correct application of scientific principles. What is not so familar to most people is the extent of the obligation under which science generally lies to horticulture. Should any reader require an illustration of this, let him turn to the \u201cOrigin of Species,\u201d and specially to the \u201cVariation of Animals and Plants under Domestication.\u201d There is scarcely a page in the chapters of those volumes relating to plants that does not abound in references to the practices and the discoveries of horticulturists. Fertilization, cross-breeding, hybridization, selection, grafting, the limits and nature of variation, are only a few of the subjects on which horticulture furnishes the largest and in many respects the most trustworthy body of evidence yet available. That these subjects are studied, and that the experiments are made, not so much from a scientific as from a utilitarian point of view, is surely no matter of reproach. On the contrary, it is the business of horticulturists to act as they do, but without the aid of a Society much of the experience gained would be lost to science. All this might be admitted as a general principle, but yet its concrete application to the Royal Horticultural Society might be from various causes inappropriate. The Society in question has, however, distinct and undoubted claims to recognition for the good work it has done in science for a long period of years. The services it has rendered to science by its collectors, and the still greater value of its work in all departments of practical horticulture, should have secured for it more sympathetic and respectful treatment from its landlords. Among Societies deserving of national support and encouragement on the ground of public utility, there are few, indeed, that have greater claims than this. For years it has unfortunately been hampered by the necessity of providing amusement for a body of Fellows and visitors who cared nothing whatever for horticulture in its higher aims. Now there is a chance of the Society bursting its bonds and confining itself to its proper work\u2014the promotion of scientific and practical horticulture. The plan of catering for fashionable idlers has proved disastrous. While horticulture proper was starved, and thousands upon thousands of pounds were utterly wasted, the landlords retain the whole of the property on which their tenants expended so much, and the Society has to seek a new home. In spite of all this, however, a valiant attempt has been made throughout long years of depression to maintain the scientific traditions of the Society. There has always been a small body of Fellows who have been mindful of the obligation which Thomas Andrew Knight, so long the President of the Society, imposed upon his successors. Lindley for forty years maintained the scientific interests of horticulture in the Society, and he was assisted by Royle, by Bentham, and many others. Twenty years ago, or more, a Scientific Committee was appointed, and this body, recruited by new accessions each year, still continues its labours. Under its guidance experiments have been performed in the Society's Experimental Garden at Chiswick; under its sanction have been published numerous Reports of very great scientific interest and importance; and much more might and could have been done but for the lack of means, or rather their diversion for more questionable purposes. The Committee in question consists of some twenty or thirty naturalists of all denominations\u2014botanists, chemists, geologists, entomologists\u2014associated with amateur and professional gardeners interested in science. To this body are referred for discussion and investigation the most varied objects of natural history and vegetable pathology; before this body and its sister committees are brought all new introductions, whether of natural origin, or produced by the skill of the gardener, and which have any scientific interest. Sir Joseph Hooker is the Chairman of this Committee, the Rev. M. J. Berkeley was for many years its Secretary, and a large number of the most eminent biologists, chemists, and geologists have been or still are among its members, giving their services without fee or reward, simply in the interests of scientific horticulture. On these grounds, therefore, the sympathy and co-operation of those interested in science may be claimed on behalf of the Royal Horticultural Society. A new programme has been decided on in principle, a new home must be provided at once, for the purpose of the Society's meetings and for housing the Lindley Library. This library, it may be added, is held in trust for the benefit of the Society, and is from time to time enriched by donations and by purchase, so far as the very meagre income of the Trustees permits. The donations would be much more numerous were it generally known that the library, though primarily intended for the Fellows, yet is under certain restrictions available to outsiders, so that, though housed in the Society's rooms, it cannot be sold or made away with in any financial catastrophe which might overtake the Society. Such a fate, however, seems to be averted at present; the Society's debt is not large, and some members of the Council, or other friends, have made a good beginning by inaugurating a fund, to be used for the housing of the Society, so that ere long we may hope to see the old Society established on a more secure basis, and more potent than ever to advance those interests of science committed to its special keeping.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"37","prism.number":"947","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"176","prism.endingPage":"177","prism.copyright":"1887 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/037176d0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/037176d0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/037176d0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/037176d0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Royal Horticultural Society","citation_volume":"37","citation_issue":"947","citation_publication_date":"1887/12","citation_firstpage":"176","citation_lastpage":"177","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/037176d0","DOI":"10.1038/037176d0","citation_doi":"10.1038/037176d0","description":"THE affairs of the Royal Horticultural Society alluded to in the last issue of NATURE (p. 145) have lately obtruded themselves upon public attention, but it is probable that some readers of NATURE may consider that they have little concern with such a body.

At Bristol the meteor was first seen when about 6\u00b0 S.E. of \u03b6 Draconis, and it travelled some 8\u00b0 in the direction of \u03b2 Cephei. Colour yellow, motion very slow. The course was evidently much foreshortened close to its radiant.","dc.creator":["DENNING, W.

Nothing is said of that part of the Commissioners' scheme which applies to the Royal Victoria Hall and Morley Memorial College, probably because the amount intended for them is comparatively small\u2014\u00a36000 down for structural alterations, and \u00a31000 a year to be divided between Hall and College. But it derives an importance beyond what is due to the amount of the grant, from the fact that it is no castle in the air, but a going concern, and had begun its useful, life long before the Commissioners had planned their scheme.

By heating a nickel plate before the magnet, it was repulsed by the magnet, and a succeeding plate was attracted, so that the wheel commenced to rotate.","dc.creator":["KARAMATE, KONSTANTIN"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["KARAMATE, KONSTANTIN"],"citation_author_institution":["Nautical School, Buccari next Fiume, Austria"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"A Simple Heat Engine","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;A Simple Heat Engine&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"045490a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

On the first of last October, several were put aside to have no drink; at the time of writing, three months and a half later, they are eating heartily of the dryest of maize and grass seeds, on which alone they have been fed, and they act as if able to endure the experiment a month or two longer.","dc.creator":["GARMAN, S."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["GARMAN, S."],"citation_author_institution":["Cambridge, U.S.A."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Thirst-endurance in some Vertebrates","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Thirst-endurance in some Vertebrates&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"051416a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

During a gale it was blown from the top of an elm tree in the heronry on Stoke Hall estate in Notts, the seat of Sir Henry Bromley, Bart. It is of unusual size, and almost exclusively composed of wire of varying lengths and thickness; the centre, or \u201ccup,\u201d alone being composed of fine twigs, grasses and feathers.

During a gale it was blown from the top of an elm tree in the heronry on Stoke Hall estate in Notts, the seat of Sir Henry Bromley, Bart. It is of unusual size, and almost exclusively composed of wire of varying lengths and thickness; the centre, or \u201ccup,\u201d alone being composed of fine twigs, grasses and feathers. Several other nests of the heronry, which had also been blown down, contained pieces of wire cleverly worked in with twigs in the usual way, but this was the only one entirely composed of that material, as far as the main structure is concerned. There are happily now a very flourishing heronry at Dallam Tower, Westmorland, the seat of Sir Henry Bromley's son, Mr. Maurice Bromley-Wilson, and although I have been familiar with it \u201coff and on\u201d for very many years, and with several other heronries in various parts of the country, I never knew of the birds using wire in the construction of their nests.

These ice-caves, not very rare in parts of the Alps and Jura, were made by the present Bishop of Bristol the subject of an attractive book (published thirty-five years ago), and have been occasionally noticed in the earlier volumes of NATURE and elsewhere. I have always believed that snow, drifted into caves during the winter, was the initial cause of these natural ice-houses (about half a dozen of which I have visited), and can quote a case from the Alps which is a slight variation of that described by Prof. Hughes. On July 24, 1873, I went up the Pic d'Arzinol (9845 feet) from Evolena in the Val d'H\u00e9rens, and on the way down\u2014so far as I remember between five and six thousand feet above sea-level\u2014my guide diverged from the track to show me what he called the Pertuis Freiss. These were two fissures, apparently joints, opened by a slight subsidence. A description of one will serve for both, except that there was hardly any descent to its floor. The fissure extended some four yards into the hill, and was at widest about many feet, Ice was patehed, about the, floor, and in places formed a plaster on the walls, its thickness being at most three inches. It showed prismatic structure, though rather small. The air within was cold (I had no thermometer); but as the surface of the ice was wet, it was above 32\u00b0 F., though I think not much.

These ice-caves, not very rare in parts of the Alps and Jura, were made by the present Bishop of Bristol the subject of an attractive book (published thirty-five years ago), and have been occasionally noticed in the earlier volumes of NATURE and elsewhere. I have always believed that snow, drifted into caves during the winter, was the initial cause of these natural ice-houses (about half a dozen of which I have visited), and can quote a case from the Alps which is a slight variation of that described by Prof. Hughes. On July 24, 1873, I went up the Pic d'Arzinol (9845 feet) from Evolena in the Val d'H\u00e9rens, and on the way down\u2014so far as I remember between five and six thousand feet above sea-level\u2014my guide diverged from the track to show me what he called the Pertuis Freiss. These were two fissures, apparently joints, opened by a slight subsidence. A description of one will serve for both, except that there was hardly any descent to its floor. The fissure extended some four yards into the hill, and was at widest about many feet, Ice was patehed, about the, floor, and in places formed a plaster on the walls, its thickness being at most three inches. It showed prismatic structure, though rather small. The air within was cold (I had no thermometer); but as the surface of the ice was wet, it was above 32\u00b0 F., though I think not much. The guide told me that the fissures in winter-time were filled with snow. This accumulation, probably owing to the shape of the fissure, no longer remained as snow, but was represented by the ice on the floor and walls, which the guide said seldom, if ever, disappeared. The absence of ice from the walls of the Ingleborough \u201cswallow hole\u201d was probably due to some exceptional dryness of the rock; but Prof. Hughes has undoubtedly found a \u201cbaby\u201d ice-cave, like that I have described, and it will be worth examining some more of these dry shafts to see whether a slightly better developed specimen may not be lurking in the neighbourhood.","dc.creator":["BONNEY, T.

How does it come to pass that in autumn the leaves of some of our forest trees exhibit a brilliant livery of crimson, while others exhibit only a yellow or golden glory? Take, for instance, the case of the ash constituents in the dry substance of the leaf. It is known by analysis that the percentage of ash increases through nearly the whole life of the leaf in beech, sycamore, elm, but not in oak, larch, cherry, &c.; it depends a good deal on whether some one ash constituent (generally lime or silica) is being steadily stored up. For example, the dry leaf of Acer campestre on May 1 has 6 per cent. ash, and in October 16.2 per cent. ash; the dry leaf of Prunus aviumhas on April 28, 7.8 per cent., and on October 2, 7.2 per cent. ash. Now the leaf of the former tree is only yellow in autumn and never red, while that of the latter is very often beautifully crimson. In the former case there is a kind of gradual decay or death of some of the cells (mostly of the upper epidermis) which occasions a drainage of mineral and organic substances to these parts from the still living tissues. This drainage and accumulation attest, in fact, such a decay; and what is more, they seem to have a distinct influence over the ultimate autumnal coloration of the leaf itself. It is easy to understand, in fact, that the leaves which exhibit such a decay and approach to dissolution are just these wherein the chromogen precursive of the brilliant red coloration would likewise suffer an analogous kind of change, i.e. it would tend to become brown, to produce phlobaphene, just as it does in the outer bark which is the practically dead portion of the rind. Where this accumulation of mineral matter and all which it implies does not take place, as in cherries, currants, American oaks, pears, wild vine, barberry, &c., then the chromogen does not deteriorate; it evolves its proper pigment, and assumes the flush and glow of active living colour. On the other hand, in elms, chestnut, linden, birch, poplars, &c., which are never red but only yellow, it is only the vivid carotin attached to the last faded and now exhausted chlorophyll which gleams forth, but only for a time, and if not too much obstructed by the dull browns of decomposed carbohydrates and superoxidised tannic chromogens.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"62","prism.number":"1613","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"523","prism.endingPage":"524","prism.copyright":"1900 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/062523e0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/062523e0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/062523e0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/062523e0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Leaf Decay and Autumn Tints","citation_volume":"62","citation_issue":"1613","citation_publication_date":"1900/09","citation_firstpage":"523","citation_lastpage":"524","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/062523e0","DOI":"10.1038/062523e0","citation_doi":"10.1038/062523e0","description":"\u201cOBSERVATION shows,\u201d says Emile Mer, \u201cthat in most cases where wood dies in contact with living wood there is produced from the second towards the first a migration of starch and tannin, and (in a conifer) of resin; there is thus produced from the portions remaining living towards the dying or dead portions a drainage of substances, &c.\u201d These remarks refer to the formation of secondary periderm and of the duramen, but their scope and tenour may perhaps, I think, be extended to the case of forest leaves approaching the end of their existence as living organs.

It was important that the work should be begun as soon as possible, and especially so in order that the sea-temperatures, &c., should not go unrecorded in this abnormal season; but it would have been impossible to begin at so short notice had not Dr. Hjort, the director of the Norwegian investigation, helped by the loan of apparatus and by permitting his hydrographic assistant, Mr. Helland-Hansen, to come over and inaugurate the work. The Admiralty gave the use of H.M.S. Jackal; Lieutenant and Commander Sharpe and Mr. Helland-Hansen were conjointly responsible for the observations, and the report will be drawn up by Mr. Helland-Hansen, who has sent me the preliminary account which follows.

It was important that the work should be begun as soon as possible, and especially so in order that the sea-temperatures, &c., should not go unrecorded in this abnormal season; but it would have been impossible to begin at so short notice had not Dr. Hjort, the director of the Norwegian investigation, helped by the loan of apparatus and by permitting his hydrographic assistant, Mr. Helland-Hansen, to come over and inaugurate the work. The Admiralty gave the use of H.M.S. Jackal; Lieutenant and Commander Sharpe and Mr. Helland-Hansen were conjointly responsible for the observations, and the report will be drawn up by Mr. Helland-Hansen, who has sent me the preliminary account which follows.

Place a piece of white paper, on which a broad black band has been ruled horizontally, just beyond the shortest distance of distinct vision from the eye, and while looking at the upper edge of the black band, cover the pupil progressively from, below by means of a card with its upper edge horizontal, placed as near as possible to the eye.

On covering up the pupil from below, the true image is obscured, and that formed by the rays traversing the upper edge of the pupil is-alone seen.","dc.creator":["EDSER, EDWIN"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["EDSER, EDWIN"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Spherical Aberration of the Eye","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Spherical Aberration of the Eye&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"067612a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

I meant potentiality of appearing within a given time, the time of the experiment, and I cannot help thinking this was the natural sense of my words.","dc.creator":["HOOKHAM, GEORGE"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["HOOKHAM, GEORGE"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Origin of Life","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Origin of Life&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"071365a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

If an explored hedge skirts on one side a public road, an \u201coccupation\u201d road, or right-of-way paths, it will be generally found that the nests are on the field side of the hedge, and, therefore, when looked for from the other side, much more difficult to discover than if they were placed on the road or pathway side. In cases where the hedge divides a field from a plantation, the nests are invariably on the plantation side. I knew that very well when I was a boy \u201cnester\u201d, and was struck with it only a few days ago on examining a long stretch of hedge-fencing from a semi-public road near my home. However, there may be some esoteric law of bird-life in what Lieut.-Colonel Walsh says. Certainly his facts are most interesting.","dc.creator":["MURDOCH, G.

I repeated a suggestion made by many, viz., that a simple solution to the whole question would be to commence work one hour earlier during the summer, and do this without confusing ourselves and others without altering the clocks. Why Mr. Southerns quotes me as saying one hour later I do not know.

This tendency of hot air to deposit its dust on cold surfaces can be seen in a very marked way in any house heated with hot water or steam. Wherever a hot pipe comes through a wall there will always be found a dirty vertical streak on the wall just above the hot pipe, caused by the stream of hot air rising from the pipe depositing its dust on the cold surface.","dc.creator":["AITKEN, JOHN"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["AITKEN, JOHN"],"citation_author_institution":["Ardenlea, Falkirk"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Cause of Streaks upon Lath and Plaster Walls","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Cause of Streaks upon Lath and Plaster Walls&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"095034b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

European and American anthropologists look forward with great interest to the publication of a detailed account of the Boskop discovery.","dc.creator":["KEITH, ARTHUR"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["KEITH, ARTHUR"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Pal\u00e6olithic Man in South Africa","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Pal&#230;olithic Man in South Africa&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"096087c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In a recent paper (Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc., June, 1915) G. W. White has published some experimental work confirming this view. The most striking effect noticed is the cyclical variation in the intensity of the tone obtained when the instrument is forced to speak at this point.

In a recent paper (Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc., June, 1915) G. W. White has published some experimental work confirming this view. The most striking effect noticed is the cyclical variation in the intensity of the tone obtained when the instrument is forced to speak at this point. White suggests as an explanation of these fluctuations of intensity that they are due to the beats which accompany the forced vibration imposed on the resonator. The correctness of this suggestion seems open to serious criticism. For the beats which are produced when a periodic force acts on a vibrator are essentially transitory in character, whereas in the present case the fluctuations in intensity are persistent.","dc.creator":["RAMAN, C.

This region contains the glutamate receptor 6 (GluR6 or GRIK2) gene, a functional candidate for the syndrome. Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and is directly involved in cognitive functions such as memory and learning. We used two different approaches, the affected sib-pair (ASP) method and the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT), to investigate the linkage and association between GluR6 and autism. The ASP method, conducted with additional markers on the 51 original families and in eight new sibling pairs, showed a significant excess of allele sharing, generating an elevated multipoint maximum LOD score (ASPEX MLS = 3.28). TDT analysis, performed in the ASP families and in an independent data set of 107 parent-offspring trios, indicated a significant maternal transmission disequilibrium (TDTall P = 0.0004). Furthermore, TDT analysis (with only one affected proband per family) showed significant association between GluR6 and autism (TDT association P = 0.008). In contrast to maternal transmission, paternal transmission of GluR6 alleles was as expected in the absence of linkage, suggesting a maternal effect such as imprinting. Mutation screening was performed in 33 affected individuals, revealing several nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including one amino acid change (M867I) in a highly conserved domain of the intracytoplasmic C-terminal region of the protein. This change is found in 8% of the autistic subjects and in 4% of the control population and seems to be more maternally transmitted than expected to autistic males (P = 0.007).

Smooth-muscle contraction is regulated by the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and by the Ca2+ sensitivity of myofilaments1: the former activates myosin light-chain kinase and the latter is achieved partly by inhibition of myosin phosphatase1,2,3. The small GTPase Rho and its target, Rho-associated kinase, participate in this latter mechanism in vitro4,5,6, but their participation has not been demonstrated in intact muscles. Here we show that a pyridine derivative, Y-27632, selectively inhibits smooth-muscle contraction by inhibiting Ca2+ sensitization.

Smooth-muscle contraction is regulated by the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and by the Ca2+ sensitivity of myofilaments1: the former activates myosin light-chain kinase and the latter is achieved partly by inhibition of myosin phosphatase1,2,3. The small GTPase Rho and its target, Rho-associated kinase, participate in this latter mechanism in vitro4,5,6, but their participation has not been demonstrated in intact muscles. Here we show that a pyridine derivative, Y-27632, selectively inhibits smooth-muscle contraction by inhibiting Ca2+ sensitization. We identified the Y-27632 target as a Rho-associated protein kinase, p160ROCK7. Y-27632 consistently suppresses Rho-induced, p160ROCK-mediated formation of stress fibres in cultured cells and dramatically corrects hypertension in several hypertensive rat models.

The skull preserves traits widely thought to be derived for extant and fossil members of a proposed Sivapithecus/Pongo clade, but which now appear to be primitive features of ancestral Old World higher primates in general.","dc.creator":["Benefit, Brenda R.","McCrossin, Monte L."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=New hominoid skull material from the Miocene of Pakistan.; citation_author=DR Pilbeam; citation_volume=295; citation_publication_date=1982; citation_pages=232-234; citation_doi=10.1038/295232a0; citation_id=CR1","citation_title=Orang-utan Biology; citation_publication_date=1988; citation_id=CR2; citation_author=B Brown; citation_author=S Ward","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=Recent discoveries of Dryopithecus shed new light on evolution of great apes.; citation_author=S Moya-Sola, M Kohler; citation_volume=365; citation_publication_date=1993; citation_pages=543-545; citation_doi=10.1038/365543a0; citation_id=CR3","citation_journal_title=J.

Assuming a density in the range of 1 to 2\u2009g\u2009cm-3, the albedo of the binary components is between 0.05 and 0.08, close to the value of 0.04 generally assumed for Kuiper-belt objects.","dc.creator":["Veillet, Christian","Parker, Joel Wm.","Griffin, Ian","Marsden, Brian","Doressoundiram, Alain","Buie, Marc","Tholen, David J.","Connelley, Michael","Holman, Matthew J."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=Discovery and physical properties of Dactyl, a satellite of asteroid 243 Ida; citation_author=CR Chapman; citation_volume=374; citation_publication_date=1995; citation_pages=783-785; citation_doi=10.1038/374783a0; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Icarus; citation_title=The discovery and orbit of 1993 (243)1 Dactyl; citation_author=MJS Belton; citation_volume=120; citation_publication_date=1995; citation_pages=185-199; citation_doi=10.1006/icar.1996.0044; citation_id=CR2","Margot, J.

This four-electron reduction process is coupled to translocation (pumping) of four protons across the mitochondrial or bacterial membrane1; however, proton pumping is poorly understood. Proton pumping was thought to be linked exclusively to the oxidative phase, that is, to the transfer of the third and fourth electron2. Upon re-evaluation of these data, however, this proposal has been questioned3,4, and a transport mechanism including proton pumping in the reductive phase\u2014that is, during the transfer of the first two electrons\u2014was suggested.

This four-electron reduction process is coupled to translocation (pumping) of four protons across the mitochondrial or bacterial membrane1; however, proton pumping is poorly understood. Proton pumping was thought to be linked exclusively to the oxidative phase, that is, to the transfer of the third and fourth electron2. Upon re-evaluation of these data, however, this proposal has been questioned3,4, and a transport mechanism including proton pumping in the reductive phase\u2014that is, during the transfer of the first two electrons\u2014was suggested. Subsequently, additional studies reported that proton pumping during the reductive phase can occur, but only when it is immediately preceded by an oxidative phase5.

This remarkable observation suggests that there is a crustal-level interaction between the magma systems of Mauna Loa and Kilauea, reviving a century-old controversy over the relationship between these two volcanoes on the basis of differences in their lava chemistry and in their patterns of eruptive behaviour1,2,3,4,5.","dc.creator":["Miklius, Asta","Cervelli, Peter"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Am.

Now it seems there may be a \u2018stop\u2019 sign to augment the familiar \u2018go\u2019 in Pharaoh's ants. They use a repellent pheromone to mark unrewarding paths, concentrating the signal at decision points such as trail bifurcations. Forager ants lay attractive trail pheromones to guide nestmates to food1,2, but the effectiveness of foraging networks might be improved if pheromones could also be used to repel foragers from unrewarding routes3,4. Here we present empirical evidence for such a negative trail pheromone, deployed by Pharaoh's ants (Monomorium pharaonis) as a \u2018no entry\u2019 signal to mark an unrewarding foraging path.

Now it seems there may be a \u2018stop\u2019 sign to augment the familiar \u2018go\u2019 in Pharaoh's ants. They use a repellent pheromone to mark unrewarding paths, concentrating the signal at decision points such as trail bifurcations. Forager ants lay attractive trail pheromones to guide nestmates to food1,2, but the effectiveness of foraging networks might be improved if pheromones could also be used to repel foragers from unrewarding routes3,4. Here we present empirical evidence for such a negative trail pheromone, deployed by Pharaoh's ants (Monomorium pharaonis) as a \u2018no entry\u2019 signal to mark an unrewarding foraging path.

In the absence of bottom-up visual inputs, single inferior temporal neurons were activated by the top-down signal, which conveyed information on semantic categorization imposed by visual stimulus\u2013stimulus association. Behavioural performance was severely impaired with loss of the top-down signal. Control experiments confirmed that the signal was transmitted not through a subcortical but through a fronto-temporal cortical pathway. Thus, feedback projections from prefrontal cortex to the posterior association cortex2,3,14 appear to serve the executive control of voluntary recall.","dc.creator":["Tomita, Hyoe","Ohbayashi, Machiko","Nakahara, Kiyoshi","Hasegawa, Isao","Miyashita, Yasushi"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_title=Handbook of Physiology; citation_publication_date=1987; citation_id=CR1; citation_author=PS Goldman-Rakic","citation_title=The Prefrontal Cortex: Anatomy, Physiology, and Neuropsychology of the Frontal Lobe; citation_publication_date=1997; citation_id=CR2; citation_author=JM Fuster","citation_title=Handbook of Neuropsychology; citation_publication_date=1994; citation_id=CR3; citation_author=M Petrides","Miyashita,Y. in The Cognitive Neurosciences 2nd edn (ed.

Lithium is a factor of 140 less abundant in the solar photosphere than in meteorites2; this difference has been attributed to the destruction of lithium (through nuclear reactions) at the base of the Sun's convection zone3,4,5.

We are aware of two chromosomal components, centromeres and telomeres, which share the potential to influence chromosome movement during meioses and make the following predictions based on the presence of female meiotic drive: (1) centromere-binding proteins should experience rapid evolution as a result of a conflict between driving centromeres and the rest of the genome; and (2) segregation patterns should be skewed near centromeres and telomeres.

The device is a layered structure prepared by depositing a 2D array of AuNPs on a transparent conductive substrate (10\u00a0nm indium tin oxide (ITO) layer on quartz), coating the 2D array of AuNPs with a monolayer of trimethoxyoctylsilane (TMOS), and depositing titania nanocrystals on the anchoring molecule (TMOS) layer. The visible light activity of the device was tested using photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) by illuminating the device with visible light (700\u00a0nm light) and ultraviolet (UV) light (250\u2013380\u00a0nm). The localized surface plasmon resonance peak of the 36\u00a0nm AuNP 2D array is around 700\u00a0nm with a full-width at half-maximum of 350\u00a0nm. In comparison with other control samples, the device showed the highest photocatalytic activity with visible irradiation, which was 1.7 times higher than that of titania with UV irradiation. The origin of the visible light activity was confirmed by both quadratic incident light power dependency and action spectrum to be plasmon-induced (near-field enhancement by AuNPs) two-photon absorption. Researchers in Japan have developed a visible-light-driven photocatalyst by exploiting the plasmonic properties of gold nanoparticles. Francesca Pincella and co-workers fabricated the photocatalyst by depositing a two-dimensional array of gold nanoparticles on top of a transparent conductive substrate of indium-tin-oxide-coated quartz. They then covered the gold nanoparticles with a monolayer of trimethoxyoctylsilane, which acts as an anchoring agent for the final layer of titania nanocrystals. Experiments involving the photocatalytic breakdown of methylene blue under visible (700\u00a0nm) and ultraviolet (250\u2013380\u00a0nm) light suggest that operation is considerably superior to that of conventional titania photocatalysts. The performance in the visible region is attributed to two-photon absorption, which is boosted by the plasmon resonance and near-field enhancement of the gold nanoparticles.","prism.publicationName":"Light: Science & Applications","prism.publicationDate":"2014-01-17","prism.volume":"3","prism.number":"1","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"e133","prism.endingPage":"e133","prism.copyright":"2014 The Author(s)","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201414","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2014.14","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201414.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201414","citation_journal_title":"Light: Science & Applications","citation_journal_abbrev":"Light Sci Appl","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"2047-7538","citation_title":"A visible light-driven plasmonic photocatalyst","citation_volume":"3","citation_issue":"1","citation_publication_date":"2014/01","citation_online_date":"2014/01/17","citation_firstpage":"e133","citation_lastpage":"e133","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2014.14","DOI":"10.1038/lsa.2014.14","citation_doi":"10.1038/lsa.2014.14","description":"We demonstrate a bottom-up approach to fabricating a visible light-driven titania photocatalyst device bearing an embedded two-dimensional (2D) array of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as a near-field light-generating layer.

Xinghui Yin at the University of Stuttgart, Germany, and co-workers fabricated gold patterned nanostructures on a layer of the phase-change material germanium\u2212antimony\u2212tellurium (GeSbTe; GST). Since the amorphous and crystalline phases of the GST layer have very different optical dielectric constants, thermally triggering a phase change in the layer allowed a 3.1\u2009\u03bcm wavelength light beam to be steered in different directions. A different design of the gold nanopattern realized a cylindrical bifocal lens that had different focal lengths for the amorphous and crystalline GST phases. This demonstration opens the way for a wide range of active optical elements based on plasmonic metasurfaces.","dc.creator":["Yin, Xinghui","Steinle, Tobias","Huang, Lingling","Taubner, Thomas","Wuttig, Matthias","Zentgraf, Thomas","Giessen, Harald"],"dc.subject":["Adaptive optics","Metamaterials"],"citation_reference":["Sullivan LH .

To derive quantitative concentration changes from measurements of light attenuation, the optical path length must be known. This is obtained by multiplying the source/detector separation by a laboratory measured differential path length factor (DPF) which accounts for the increased distance traveled by light due to scattering. DPF has been measured by time of flight techniques on small populations of adults and postmortem infants. The values for adults are greater than those for newborns, and it is not clear how to interpolate the present data for studies on children. Recent developments in instrumentation using phase resolved spectroscopy techniques have produced a bedside unit which can measure optical path length on any subject. We have developed an intensity modulated optical spectrometer which measures path length at four wavelengths. Two hundred and eighty three subjects from 1 d of age to 50 y were studied.

To derive quantitative concentration changes from measurements of light attenuation, the optical path length must be known. This is obtained by multiplying the source/detector separation by a laboratory measured differential path length factor (DPF) which accounts for the increased distance traveled by light due to scattering. DPF has been measured by time of flight techniques on small populations of adults and postmortem infants. The values for adults are greater than those for newborns, and it is not clear how to interpolate the present data for studies on children. Recent developments in instrumentation using phase resolved spectroscopy techniques have produced a bedside unit which can measure optical path length on any subject. We have developed an intensity modulated optical spectrometer which measures path length at four wavelengths. Two hundred and eighty three subjects from 1 d of age to 50 y were studied. Measurements were made at a fixed frequency of 200 MHz and a source detector separation of 4.5 cm. Results suggest a slowly varying age dependence of DPF, following the relation DPF690 = 5.38 + 0.049A0.877, DPF744 = 5.11 + 0.106A0.723, DPF807 = 4.99 + 0.067A0.814, and DPF832 = 4.67 + 0.062A0.819, where DPF690 is the DPF measured at 690 nm and A is age is expressed in years from full term.
