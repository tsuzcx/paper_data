WALLACE, in replying to Mr. Howorth's objections to the theory of Natural Selection, points out that that gentleman first misrepresents Darwinism, and that having done so he does not employ the distorted doctrine as premisses to a further conclusion. But the second part of the criticism is not quite just. Mr. Howorth, after stating the Darwinism theory, introduces us to an order of facts which is at variance with that theory as apprehended by him; and not only does he do so, but he places an interpretation upon these facts which is utterly irreconcilable with the Darwinian theory as understood by its most able expositors. It is true that Mr. Howorth does not bring his interpretation of the facts he adduces and the theory of natural selection into such juxtaposition as to show their mutual contradiction; but a little consideration will enable Mr. Wallace to supply the missing links, and to see that in any generous construction of Mr. Howorth's letter, the real questions at issue are the correctness of the facts he adduces and the validity of the generalisation he makes from these facts. My object in writing is to direct Mr. Howorth's attention to Mr. Herbert Spencer's profound discussion of this subject, as it appears to have escaped his notice.

On the 19th I began to watch at 10h, but saw no more until 11 45. I then watched them until 3h 15m. I found they seemed to come in the region of the heavens about Corona, so I confined my observations to that part as I had not a situation where I could see the opposite side as well By 10 o'clock Hercules was quite above the building, so there may have been some meteors visible earlier, when these constellations were too low for me to see. The first night they were all comprised in a triangle, which would be formed by a line stretching from Vega by way of Ophiuchus to Mars, and thence up to Arcturus and by Corona back to Vega. They were pretty equally distributed over this region. The next night they were much more concentrated in Ophiuchus and Hercules and towards Libra. I was not able to determine the radiant, so I confined myself to reckoning them accurately in intervals of fifteen minutes, which time I had conveniently marked for me by the church clocks, and only observed their tracks approximately. On the second night I noted the position and direction of each which shows their concentration about the part named. On the nineteenth there were 25\u201415 horizontal, 10 vertical. On the 20th from 9.45 to 2.45 there were 33\u201422 vertical and 11 horizontal. Those I call vertical by distinction were almost all just half way between horizontal and vertical, i.e. at an angle of 45\u00b0. It was curious how this angle predominated. It was also curious that the first night the horizontal ones predominated, and the second night the vertical. I do not know if I am wrong (1) in assuming that we pass through the node of the orbit of the meteors at this time, and (2) in inferring from this assumption that the angle at which they principally appear to us would be a guide to the inclination of the node. Would the fact of their being horizontal be any proof that the inclination of their orbit is small, and their being vertical a proof that it is much greater, and of a somewhat similar angle? But this would not explain the fact of the majority being horizontal the first night and the majority at a greater angle the next night. One seen on the 20th was intermittent, it ran for a long distance, and became visible at intervals of a few seconds a little way farther on. Only a few were of any size, and the first night all but two were extremely small and very faint, with Very short tracks. The next night they were not only greater in number but larger, brighter, and with longer tracks. A few left tracks lasting a second or two. One only moved very fast. The first night there was one quite vertical upwards. This was the only instance. The majority were from E. to S. or E. to W. on both nights; and the only two of any length on the 19th were one running out of Corona and one running into it. It seemed curious to me how these should be so much longer than all the others and yet lie so close to the point of apparent divergence of them all.

Mr. Darwin (\u201cOrigin of Species,\u201d sixth edition, p. 73) says: \u201cCertain plants excrete sweet juice, apparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from the sap; this is effected, for instance, by glands at the base of the stipules in some Leguminos\u00e6, and at the backs of the leaves of the common laurel. This juice, though small in quantity, is greedily sought by insects; but their visits do not in any way benefit the plant.\u201d Glands cannot be considered very complex modifications of cellular tissue. They exist on all parts of plants, and contain a great variety of secretions. Mr. Darwin and others have shown that they perform the varied functions of secreting nectar to attract insects to flowers, of secreting odorous matter for the same purpose, of absorbing ammonia from rain-water and the products of decomposed or digested animal or vegetable matter, and of secreting acids capable of digesting solids. The existence of free acids in the plant would be injurious to it, so that their excretion would be beneficial to it apart from any digestive function which they may in some cases perform. The glands of the laurel are so far unspecialised that they are by no means constant in number or size. As their attracting insects is of no service to the plant, the nectar must be said to be excreted ; but, being what Sachs has termed (p. 629) a \u201csecondary product of metastasis,\u201d it should be looked upon rather as a physiologically accidental excretion than as positively injurious, as a substance which, having ceased to take part in the processes of growth, has not acquired an indirect function as has the nectar of flowers. To account for the position of the glands it may be suggested that, as in other evergreens, the leaves of the laurel are \u201creservoirs of reserve material\u201d in which metastasis, including the separation of the \u201cformative materials\u201d from the \u201csecondary products,\u201d mainly takes place (Sachs, p. 627).","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"13","prism.number":"319","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"107","prism.endingPage":"107","prism.copyright":"1875 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/013107a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/013107a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/013107a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/013107a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Glands of the Cherry Laurel","citation_volume":"13","citation_issue":"319","citation_publication_date":"1875/12","citation_firstpage":"107","citation_lastpage":"107","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/013107a0","DOI":"10.1038/013107a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/013107a0","description":"IN NATURE (vol. viii., p. 245) Mr. Thiselton Dyer, in answer to a correspondent, says that he knows of no explanation? of the purpose or origin of the nectariferous glands on the back of the leaf of the cherry laurel.

As he requests further information, may I be permitted to contribute the following:\u2014I once observed a pheasant which, after being shot, flew apparently untouched for about one hundred yards, then towered ten or fifteen yards, and fell dead. As a rule birds that have towered are picked up dead, as Mr. Romanes states; but such is not invariably the case. A correspondence took place in the Field some weeks since in answer to the question: \u201cDo towered birds ever rise again,\u201d and several replies were elicited in the affirmative. The conclusion warranted by that correspondence seemed to be that towering arises from at least two distinct kinds of injury. In the first, the common form, the bird is struck in the back, and is always found precisely where marked down. It seems to me that in this kind of towering the perpendicular flight may be attributed to a cause perhaps other than, or at all events additional to, pulmonary h\u00e6morrhage. I consider that h\u00e6morrhage is a necessary factor, and Mr. Romanes makes out a very strong case in favour of its being into the lungs. That the movements of the wings are convulsive, and the explanation of the towering, I am not inclined to dispute, but I think it has yet to be proved that the convulsive flapping of wings (the directing power of the brain being in abeyance) always produces perpendicular and never merely erratic flight. Every towering bird acts in a precisely similar way. Are we to take it for granted that in asphyxia it is only certain sets of muscles, and these always in the same and to an equal degree, that are spasmodically affected? I have noticed that a towering bird very often has his legs hanging straight down (I do not allude to those cases where they are palpably mutilated), and it strikes me as being likely that paralysis of the legs and lower part of the back may have something to do with the flight being upward.

As he requests further information, may I be permitted to contribute the following:\u2014I once observed a pheasant which, after being shot, flew apparently untouched for about one hundred yards, then towered ten or fifteen yards, and fell dead. As a rule birds that have towered are picked up dead, as Mr. Romanes states; but such is not invariably the case. A correspondence took place in the Field some weeks since in answer to the question: \u201cDo towered birds ever rise again,\u201d and several replies were elicited in the affirmative. The conclusion warranted by that correspondence seemed to be that towering arises from at least two distinct kinds of injury. In the first, the common form, the bird is struck in the back, and is always found precisely where marked down. It seems to me that in this kind of towering the perpendicular flight may be attributed to a cause perhaps other than, or at all events additional to, pulmonary h\u00e6morrhage. I consider that h\u00e6morrhage is a necessary factor, and Mr. Romanes makes out a very strong case in favour of its being into the lungs. That the movements of the wings are convulsive, and the explanation of the towering, I am not inclined to dispute, but I think it has yet to be proved that the convulsive flapping of wings (the directing power of the brain being in abeyance) always produces perpendicular and never merely erratic flight. Every towering bird acts in a precisely similar way. Are we to take it for granted that in asphyxia it is only certain sets of muscles, and these always in the same and to an equal degree, that are spasmodically affected? I have noticed that a towering bird very often has his legs hanging straight down (I do not allude to those cases where they are palpably mutilated), and it strikes me as being likely that paralysis of the legs and lower part of the back may have something to do with the flight being upward. A man who has paraplegia always complains that he cannot move his legs because they are so heavy. This sensation would doubtless be felt by a bird paralysed behind, and this, in addition to the loss of its steering apparatus and the co-operating contractions of the posterior muscles, would produce a loss of balance with much the same effect as though the after parts had really become disproportionately heavy. I have no desire to be dogmatic, but merely offer this as a possible assisting factor in some cases.","dc.creator":["WALTERS, J.

And Prof. Carey Foster has not called in question the correctness of my statement of the general impression which prevailed among scientific men, alike when Mr. Crookes first exhibited his radiometer at the soir\u00e9e of the Royal Society, and when its phenomena were discussed at the subsequent meeting. Having followed that discussion with the greatest interest, I cannot now recall one word that was not in harmony with the \u201cdirect impact\u201d doctrine, or that suggested the idea of \u201cheat reaction\u201d through residual gas.

I fully admit that in giving a sketch of the history of the Radiometer, I intended to attribute to Mr. Crookes that he had in the first instance put a wrong interpretation upon his own results; because I believed that this was a simple fact, well known to everybody who had followed the history of the inquiry. And Prof. Carey Foster has not called in question the correctness of my statement of the general impression which prevailed among scientific men, alike when Mr. Crookes first exhibited his radiometer at the soir\u00e9e of the Royal Society, and when its phenomena were discussed at the subsequent meeting. Having followed that discussion with the greatest interest, I cannot now recall one word that was not in harmony with the \u201cdirect impact\u201d doctrine, or that suggested the idea of \u201cheat reaction\u201d through residual gas. If the question had been then asked, whether the rotation would continue to take place in an open vacuum (were such possible), or in a perfect vacuum,\u2014so as to eliminate all \u201creaction\u201d, through residual gas, between the vanes and the containing flask,\u2014I believe that the general, if not the unanimous, verdict would have been in the affirmative.

Bert's researches into the growth of plants (see Comptes Rendus, vol. 87, p. 695, November 4), have led me to publish an observation which I made on the inner sheaths of young leaves this last spring.

It therefore appears probable that the green colouration of the flame is caused by very finely divided particles of the salt being carried off into the upper part of the flame by the escaping water of crystallisation. These particles then become so intensely heated as to emit the peculiar greenish light and very likely suffer previous reduction by the carbon of the flame.

It therefore appears probable that the green colouration of the flame is caused by very finely divided particles of the salt being carried off into the upper part of the flame by the escaping water of crystallisation. These particles then become so intensely heated as to emit the peculiar greenish light and very likely suffer previous reduction by the carbon of the flame.

During a voyage to India and back I took a great interest in observing the movements of these beautiful creatures by means of a powerful opera-glass; and soon came to the conclusion that a slight but rapid tremor of the pectoral fins could be seen for a few moments after the fish left the water. In very calm weather I noticed a series of little ripples on each side of the fish as it skimmed along the surface before rising for its flight, evidently caused by the wing-points tipping the water.

During a voyage to India and back I took a great interest in observing the movements of these beautiful creatures by means of a powerful opera-glass; and soon came to the conclusion that a slight but rapid tremor of the pectoral fins could be seen for a few moments after the fish left the water. In very calm weather I noticed a series of little ripples on each side of the fish as it skimmed along the surface before rising for its flight, evidently caused by the wing-points tipping the water. My idea is that the flying-fish springs from the sea, and by beating the surface rapidly with its pectoral fins obtains an impetus which carries it along for some distance in the air. It then descends to the surface, and in the same manner acquires a fresh accession of speed.

Such movements seem to be as well developed and as diversified under the bright sun of Brazil, as are the well-known sleep or nyctitropic movements of plants in all parts of the world. This result has interested me much, as I long doubted whether paraheliotropic movements were common enough to deserve to be separately designated. It is a remarkable fact that in certain species these movements closely resemble the sleep movements of allied forms. Thus the leaflets of one of the Brazilian Cassi\u00e6 assume when exposed to sunshine nearly the same position as those of the not distantly allied H\u00e6matoxylon when asleep, as shown in Fig. 153 of \u201cThe Movements of Plants.\u201d Whereas the leaflets of this Cassia sleep by moving down and rotating on their axes, in the same peculiar manner as in so many other species of the genus. Again, with an unnamed species of Phyllanthus, the leaves move forwards at night, so that their midribs then stand nearly parallel to the horizontal branches from which they spring; but when they are exposed to bright sunshine they rise up vertically, and their upper surfaces come into contact, as they are opposite. Now this is the position which the leaves of another species, namely Phyllanthus compressus, assume when they go to sleep at night. Fritz M\u00fcller states that the paraheliotropic movements of the leaves of a Mucuna, a large twining Papilionaceous plant, are strange and inexplicable; the leaflets sleep by hanging vertically down, but under bright sunshine the petiolorises vertically up, and the terminal leaflet rotates by means of its pulvinus through an angle of 180\u00b0, and thus its upper surface ends on the same side with the lower surfaces of the lateral leafles. Fritz M\u00fcller adds, \u201cI do not understand the meaning of this rotation of the terminal leaflet, as even without such a movement it would be apparently equally well protected against the rays of the sun. The leaflets, also, on many of the leaves on the same plant assume various other strange positions.\u201d With one species of Desmodium, presently to be mentioned as sleeping in a remarkable manner, the leaflets rise up vertically when exposed to bright sunshine, and the upper surfaces of the lateral leaflets are thus brought into contact.

Not only flowers, but also other parts of the plant are thus affected. I found for instance that the shoots of several potatoes grown in the dark were coloured pink, that a bud of an elder-tree formed under the same circumstances two red-coloured internodes, and that crocuses, tulips, and hyacinths produced coloured flowers, whereas Aucuba japonica gave redcoloured fruits. It seems from these experiments that the plant is able to produce colouring matter without help from any source of light. But it is an important fact that the colours formed in he dark and those formed in the light often do not possess the ame beauty. To prove this, I raised a bulb of byacinth with wo buds (or \u201cnoses\u201d as they are called by Dutch florists); one of the two buds was covered by a piece of thick opaque paper to prevent the sun shining upon it, while the other bud was uncovered, and thus could enjoy the sun's influence. After some weeks the difference was very marked, the covered flowers being less intensively coloured than the others. This way of experimenting gave more striking results than that proposed by Askenasy, who kept the hyacinths in the dark until the whole inflorescence had opened, then cut off the upper part of the flower stalk with half of the flowers and exposed it to daylight, while the others remained in their dark place.

The sky was nearly unclouded, and the moon had not yet risen; a band of light forming an arc extended from west to east, under the Polar Star. It just touched, by its upper boundary, the stars \u03b3 and \u03b2 of the Great Bear, and nearly touched by its lower fringe the star Cor Caroli; this gives some idea of its breadth. Beams of light extended from the upper fringe towards the North Star, with greater or less intensity, fading away, however, very rapidly.

The sky was nearly unclouded, and the moon had not yet risen; a band of light forming an arc extended from west to east, under the Polar Star. It just touched, by its upper boundary, the stars \u03b3 and \u03b2 of the Great Bear, and nearly touched by its lower fringe the star Cor Caroli; this gives some idea of its breadth. Beams of light extended from the upper fringe towards the North Star, with greater or less intensity, fading away, however, very rapidly. Towards 9.30 p.m. the eastern end of the arc became very luminous; immense beams spread up into the heavens, mostly parallel to the direction of the pointers.

This latter, if we consider the close attention paid of late years to the commoner European wild flowers, has in all probability been frequently observed before. As I have not seen Schenck's handbook, I would be glad if Mr. Ransom will quote the passage to which he refers. On looking at my note-book I find that not only V. officinalis, but also V. Cham\u00e6drys and V. Beccabunga are shown as fertilised in the same manner. May I suggest that the separation of the stamens, and the difference of inclination between stamens and pistil, have been brought about in order to prevent self-fertilisation? The looseness of the corolla would then, in such a flower as V. Cham\u00e6drys, bring the anthers to a level with the stigma when an insect alighted upon it, and would thus promote cross-fertilisation. From want of more extended observations, however, I could not say what would happen in the case of a proterogynous species, or of such a flower as V. spicata. In reply to Mr. Ransom, I may add that I have no. where stated V. officinalis to possess larger flowers than V. heder\u00e6folia, and that Mr. Darwin (\u201cCross and Self-fertilisation,\u201d p. 369), in a brief reference to the genus, simply states that V. agrestis is self-fertilising, and mentions species of Syrphid\u00e6 as visiting the flowers of V. heder\u00e6folia and V. officinalis.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"27","prism.number":"686","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"174","prism.endingPage":"174","prism.copyright":"1882 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/027174b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/027174b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/027174b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/027174b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Fertilisation of the Common Speedwell","citation_volume":"27","citation_issue":"686","citation_publication_date":"1882/12","citation_firstpage":"174","citation_lastpage":"174","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/027174b0","DOI":"10.1038/027174b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/027174b0","description":"IF Mr. Ransom will refer again to my letter, he will see that it was written in order to draw attention to the adaptation of the flower for cross-fertilisation, and not especially to the fact that Diptera in settling upon it, draw down the stamens.

Murray and Renard's \u201cOrigin and Distribution of Deep-Sea Deposits,\u201d hoping that some useful comparisons would have been made between the present sea-beds and the Chalk, the Gault, and the Greensands, which appear to be among the deepest water deposits now accessible as dry land. Instead of this we are merely told that chalk \u201cmust be regarded as having been laid down rather along the border of a continent than in a trueoceanic area\u201d (NATURE, p. 134). All geologists are aware, since the publication of Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys' address to the British Association, and the appearance of Mr. Wallace's \u201cIsland Life,\u201d that some naturalists regard the Chalk as a shallow-water formation, but the former opinion, pronounced as it was by one of the most competent judges, was based exclusively on the present habits of the very few genera of Mollusca that have survived from the Chalk period, and seems quite in contradiction to the far more important groups, the Sponges, Echinodermata, and the minute organisms of which the formation is so largely composed, while no opinion has yet found its way into the hands of geologists regarding the depth of water indicated by the Crustacea and the fishes of the Chalk. Mr. Wallace's collation of the Chalk, as a formation, with the decomposed coral mud of Ooahu, is so fantastic as to have failed to carry conviction to the mind of any competent geologist. The points of resemblance between some Globigerina ooze and the Chalk are so numerous and peculiar, that surely the assertion that the latter is a littoral formation, while the former is oceanic, requires strong support. The relative analyses of chips from the Chalk and of Globigerina ooze, quoted by Mr. Wallace, are not by any means final or conclusive. We all know that the silica has been removed and segregated into flints from the White Chalk at Shoreham, and that the iron and other metals are also segregated into crystallised masses, so that a comparison of the Chalk, minus these, is misleading. In like manner the Grey Chalk at Folkestone has lost all its oxide of iron by segregation and crystallisation, and many of the layers are cherty, and unduly rich in silica obtained probably at the expense of other layers in which it is now relatively scarce. During the ages that Chalk has been elevated and has acted as a sponge for the collection of rain water, who can say what other of its constituents may not have been dissolved away or metamorphosed? Siliceous sponge skeletons have been replaced by calcite, calcite shells have been replaced by silica, whilst aragonite shells have been entirely dissolved away. In like manner, can it possibly be contended that the absence of volcanic matter in the Chalk is an important distinction between it and Atlantic ooze? It is an accidental lithological distinction, but nothing more, and merely shows that volcanic dust was not being ejected in the same masses as at present. The Cretaceous and Eocene eruptions, so far as I am aware, are all fissure eruptions of vast magnitude, and the contemporary rocks in their vicinity seem to show that they were not accompanied by the showers of ash that mark eruptions from craters at the present day. Messrs. Renard and Murray have had exceptional opportunities of studying this question, and have no doubt convincing proofs of their statement regarding the littoral character of the Chalk deposit; but I really think that, considering the national character of the undertaking which made the collection of proof possible, it should no longer be withheld. Geologists at present, supposing my feelings are generally shared, are asked to believe that an enormous formation, which shows little, if any, trace of the proximity of land, and abounds with the remains of deep-sea life, was laid down upon a coastline; but beyond the extravagant assertion that it is decomposed coral-mud no reasons whatever for this belief are brought forward, nor are any areas pointed out in which an equivalent to the Chalk is in course of deposition, I cannot conceive why our official geologists have ignored this, one of the most important questions in the whole range of the science.

I prefer, therefore, in proposing to consider Time as a fourth dimension of our existence, to speak of it as a fourth dimension rather than the fourth dimension. Since this fourth dimension cannot be introduced into space, as commonly understood, we require a new kind of space for its existence, which we may call time-space. There is then no difficulty in conceiving the analogues in this new kind of space, of the things in ordinary space which are known as lines, areas, and solids. A straight line, by moving in any direction not in its own length, generates an area; if this area moves in any direction not in its own plane it generates a solid; but if this solid moves in any direction, it still generates a solid, and nothing more. The reason of this is that we have not supposed it to move in the fourth dimension. If the straight line moves in its own direction, it describes only a straight line; if the area moves in its own plane, it describes only an area; in each case, motion in the dimensions in which the thing exists, gives us only a thing of the same dimensions; and, in order to get a thing of higher dimensions, we must have motion in a new dimension. But, as the idea of motion is only applicable in space of three dimensions, we must replace it by another which is applicable in our fourth dimension of time. Such an idea is that of successive existence.

I prefer, therefore, in proposing to consider Time as a fourth dimension of our existence, to speak of it as a fourth dimension rather than the fourth dimension. Since this fourth dimension cannot be introduced into space, as commonly understood, we require a new kind of space for its existence, which we may call time-space. There is then no difficulty in conceiving the analogues in this new kind of space, of the things in ordinary space which are known as lines, areas, and solids. A straight line, by moving in any direction not in its own length, generates an area; if this area moves in any direction not in its own plane it generates a solid; but if this solid moves in any direction, it still generates a solid, and nothing more. The reason of this is that we have not supposed it to move in the fourth dimension. If the straight line moves in its own direction, it describes only a straight line; if the area moves in its own plane, it describes only an area; in each case, motion in the dimensions in which the thing exists, gives us only a thing of the same dimensions; and, in order to get a thing of higher dimensions, we must have motion in a new dimension. But, as the idea of motion is only applicable in space of three dimensions, we must replace it by another which is applicable in our fourth dimension of time. Such an idea is that of successive existence. We must, therefore, conceive that there is a new three-dimensional space for each successive instant of time; and, by picturing to ourselves the aggregate formed by the successive positions in time-space of a given solid during a given time, we shall get the idea of a four-dimensional solid, which may be called a sur-solid. It will assist us to get a clearer idea, if we consider a solid which is in a constant state of change, both of magnitude and position; and an example of a solid which satisfies this condition sufficiently well, is afforded by the body of each of us.

It occurred on the 6th inst., a bright warm day, with a light breeze blowing from the east. The sky was free from clouds, excepting a few cirrus and cirro-stratus collections on the northern horizon. Engaged at the time in fishing from a boat on one of the Irish loughs, I was conscious of a change in the character of the light reflected from the water and distant objects and looking towards the sun (f), noticed that it was surrounded by an exceedingly brilliant halo (a b) of about 48\u00b0 diameter, the contained space (g h) being filled with vapour of a dull leaden blue colour, which, by obscuring some of the solar rays, apparently produced the peculiar light effects that first attracted my attention. The time was 1.30 in the afternoon. Calling the attention of my friend, Dr. Simpson, to the phenomenon, I recorded the accompanying details. The primary liula (a b) consisted of a brilliant, well-defined band of about 8 width, composed of the spectral colours in the usual sequence, the red ring being nearest the sun. The whole band was most vivid, but the northern half the brightest. At about two o'clock I noticed a bulging (i) of the leaden-coloured vapour of the primary halo (a b) to the extent of 6\u00b0 or 7\u00b0, and in its south-eastern quadrant, and this protrusion, at first only faintly fringed with colour, soon was bounded by a spectral bow (e) at least as vivid as the brightest portion of the primary halo. The adjacent portion of a b, whether by comparison with e or whether because partially obscured by the protrusion of the vapour around which e was formed, I cannot be sure, seemed much paler than the rest of a b. Simultaneously with the formation of this secondary bow a large white ring, represented in the drawing by c d, slowly formed around a centre to the north of the sun, and rapidly assumed a well-defined contour. Its diameter was 72\u00b0. Had it been complete it would in its southern portion have passed through the sun, but after cutting the primary halo (a b) at the points (m and n), which it rendered more faint, it gradually disappeared before reaching the sun. This latter ring (c d) began to disappear about a quarter of an hour after I first noticed it, its north western portion fading first. I noticed no mock-suns at the points of contact of either of the excentric rings, and was, unfortunately, unprovided with my small pocket polariscope, and therefore unable to ascertain how much of the phenomenon was due to double refraction. The portion (e) may have been thus produced, but it certainly appeared, as drawn, to be a portion of a ring of smaller radius than (a b). The Rev. T. G. Beaumont, who also observed this spectacle, states that he saw the primary halo (a b) gradually start from a much smaller ring around the sun. The accompanying drawing, though rough, is as accurate as compatible with the absence of measuring instruments.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"32","prism.number":"817","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"173","prism.endingPage":"173","prism.copyright":"1885 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/032173b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/032173b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/032173b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/032173b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Unusual Atmospheric Phenomenon","citation_volume":"32","citation_issue":"817","citation_publication_date":"1885/06","citation_firstpage":"173","citation_lastpage":"173","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/032173b0","DOI":"10.1038/032173b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/032173b0","description":"THE accompanying drawing\u2014a copy of a sketch taken at the time\u2014represents an unusual atmospheric phenomenon witnessed by several friends and myself during a recent visit to Ireland.

That is to say, if we assume any right-handed screw to be propelled along the current, the north pole will move in the direction of the twist in the muscles of the wrist in propelling it; and vice vers\u00e2, if the north pole move in the direction of propulsion, the current urging it will be in the direction of twist in the muscles of the wrist. In treating the movement of a conductor carrying a current in the magnetic field, I have used a rule identical in character with Amp\u00e8re's, and that was probably the rule to which J. T. B. referred in his critique, namely, that a figure swimming in the current and looking along the lines of force is carried to his left.

That is to say, if we assume any right-handed screw to be propelled along the current, the north pole will move in the direction of the twist in the muscles of the wrist in propelling it; and vice vers\u00e2, if the north pole move in the direction of propulsion, the current urging it will be in the direction of twist in the muscles of the wrist. In treating the movement of a conductor carrying a current in the magnetic field, I have used a rule identical in character with Amp\u00e8re's, and that was probably the rule to which J. T. B. referred in his critique, namely, that a figure swimming in the current and looking along the lines of force is carried to his left.

By the existing regulations a person who accepted the office of Moderator would have to take part in the examination in three consecutive years, and in his second year of office he would have to examine the candidates of one year in Part III. simultaneously with those of the year below in Parts I. and II. This led to the consideration of the whole question of the appointment of examiners. The two Moderators in each year are nominated by two colleges, according to a prescribed cycle of fifty years. This nomination by colleges, though theoretically not very defensible, had worked very fairly so long as the examination only included subjects with which any high wrangler might be expected to be acquainted; but it was clearly unsuitable for Part III. In any case the nomination of the four examiners by four independent bodies might easily bring about the result that among the various subjects included there would be some which had not been made the object of special study by any of the examiners: indeed there was nothing to prevent the four examiners being all pure mathematicians or all physicists. Accordingly, with a unanimity almost unique in matters relating to the Tripos, the Board recommended in a Report dated June 15, 1885, that the examiners for Part III. should be quite distinct from those for Parts I. and II., and that all four should be nominated by the Board. It was also proposed that they should hold office for only one year. This Report was sanctioned by the Senate on October 29, 1886.

Neither the Board nor the University would have agreed lightly to such a break in the traditions of the Senate House examination, had it been possible to retain the Moderators as examiners for the final part without altering the system of nomination by colleges. The complete separation of Part III. from the earlier parts of the examination was, however, inevitable. Many members of the University who would discharge most admirably the duty of examining for Parts I. and II. would shrink from Part III.; and the professors and specialists who were best fitted to examine in Part III. would generally be reluctant to undertake the heavy burden of examining all the candidates for Parts I. and II., especially in two consecutive years.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"35","prism.number":"896","prism.section":"BriefCommunication","prism.startingPage":"199","prism.endingPage":"203","prism.copyright":"1886 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/035199a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/035199a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/035199a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/035199a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Mathematical Tripos 1","citation_volume":"35","citation_issue":"896","citation_publication_date":"1886/12","citation_firstpage":"199","citation_lastpage":"203","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/035199a0","DOI":"10.1038/035199a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/035199a0","description":"III.

The complete separation of Part III. from the earlier parts of the examination was, however, inevitable. Many members of the University who would discharge most admirably the duty of examining for Parts I. and II. would shrink from Part III.; and the professors and specialists who were best fitted to examine in Part III. would generally be reluctant to undertake the heavy burden of examining all the candidates for Parts I. and II., especially in two consecutive years.","dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["Address delivered before the London Mathematical Society by the President, Mr. J.

As he expresses a desire to know whether any similar results have been found in India, and as I have on several occasions during the past ten years discussed the vertical distribution of temperature and pressure in this country, I gladly take this opportunity of referring him to my papers on the meteorology of the North-West Himalaya, and on the temperature of North-Western India, published in the \u201cIndian Meteorological Memoirs,\u201d vols. i. and ii.

As he expresses a desire to know whether any similar results have been found in India, and as I have on several occasions during the past ten years discussed the vertical distribution of temperature and pressure in this country, I gladly take this opportunity of referring him to my papers on the meteorology of the North-West Himalaya, and on the temperature of North-Western India, published in the \u201cIndian Meteorological Memoirs,\u201d vols. i. and ii.

I wish to say that I have frequently witnessed the occurrence, having kept pigeons for a number of years. I have often seen sparrows chase pigeons on the house-tops, particularly when the former have had their nests in the vicinity. One season, about ten years ago, I well remember the annoyance these impudent birds caused to the pigeons, for whenever the latter were let out in the morning to air themselves the sparrows would immediately attack Them and continue the harassment without intermission all day long. On one occasion, during the same year, I recollect a very amusing scene between a cock sparrow and a cock tumbler pigeon. The former had just flown on to the house-top with a large piece of bread in his bill, when the pigeon advanced rapidly towards him with the intention of seizing the dainty morsel. The plucky sparrow, however, was in readiness for him, and dropping the bread he made a bold onslaught on his larger feathered relation, pecking vigorously at his rear quarters. The pigeon not expecting an attack from such an insignificant foe, and being utterly unprepared for a \u201cround,\u201d did not attempt to use its wings as weapons, as is its custom, but contented itself with cooing, and aiming a few rapid pecks with its beak, and then ignominiously took to flight, leaving a few feathers behind in its hurry. No sooner, however, had it quitted the field than about half a dozen other sparrows, who had been sitting on the chimney-pots in the neighbourhood watching the affray, dashed after it and chased it round and round the house, about half a dozen times, before they considered that it had had sufficient punishment. Such is an example of the annoyance my pigeons were sometimes subjected to by the sparrows.

The scraper which he mentions was submitted to Dr. John Evans for his opinion, and his conclusion as given in my paper in the Proceedings of the Geologists' Association, vol. ix. p. 17, is as follows. The scraper \u201cis not of a river-drift form, so far as at present known, but is precisely like many from the French caves of the reindeer periods, such, for instance, as La Madelaine.\u201d Mr. Worthington Smith's contention therefore that it agrees exactly with \u201cthe Neolithic scrapers of Icklingham and Mildenhall\u201d can only prove that there is no chronological value in the classification of such implements. I must explain, however, that we have based no argument on the scraper referred to, since it was found, before the explorations were properly commenced, in an open part of the cavern, and, as stated by me in the paper referred to, \u201cit would be improper to dogmatize on this evidence.\u201d I may say at once that I entirely demur to any classification based on the form of the implements rather than on the fauna associated with them, and I see no reason whatever to suppose that the worn, roughly-trimmed implements usually found in river gravels are older than the better-preserved flakes and trimmed implements found in caverns, which would be used for a different purpose from the rougher ones. The implements discovered subsequently belong to the so-called oldest types found in caverns, and were associated with Mammalian remains, equally characteristic of the oldest river gravels as of the caverns.

They show side by side the record given by the seismograph itself, and the real motion of the base of the instrument when that was artificially shaken in a manner that closely imitated an earthquake. The real motion was recorded by means of a multiplying lever hinged by a universal joint in a bracket fixed to a separate support. In both records the motion is magnified about six times.

They show side by side the record given by the seismograph itself, and the real motion of the base of the instrument when that was artificially shaken in a manner that closely imitated an earthquake. The real motion was recorded by means of a multiplying lever hinged by a universal joint in a bracket fixed to a separate support. In both records the motion is magnified about six times.

These were found to be Orchestia gammarellus (the shore-hopper). About ten days ago an unusually high tide occurred, and the curator and others who were working in the biological station noticed that the steps leading to the beach were swarming with amphipods. On investigating further it was found that the amphipods were coming up in great numbers from high-water mark, that they jumped up the steps, and that they climbed the vertical concrete wall surrounding the station to a height of several feet. Many of them were found about twelve feet above the sea, having come nearly all the way on artificial ground (concrete steps and wall), and they were so abundant on the platform outside the laboratory door that it was impossible to put a foot down without treading on many. Specimens were kept, and Mr. A. O. Walker, who is here with me now, finds that these also are Orchestia gammarellus. This species lives normally at or about high-water mark, and it is abundant here under stones at that line, but Mr. Walker tells me that he has taken it on the one hand nearly at low-water mark, and on the other hand under stones on grass, along with beetles, and we have found it near here far above high-water mark at the side of the road. However, these last are probably exceptional cases, and we are both inclined to think that the two amphipod invasions noticed here have been caused by the Orchestias being driven from their usual haunts by exceptionally high tides. But whether a panic arises on the flooding of their homes, or they lose their way on our concrete, the fact remains that whereas the sea was only a couple of feet higher than an ordinary high tide the amphipods ascended on the one occasion to about twelve and on the other to perhaps twenty feet above their usual level.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"48","prism.number":"1228","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"28","prism.endingPage":"28","prism.copyright":"1893 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/048028a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/048028a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/048028a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/048028a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Swarms of Amphipods","citation_volume":"48","citation_issue":"1228","citation_publication_date":"1893/05","citation_firstpage":"28","citation_lastpage":"28","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/048028a0","DOI":"10.1038/048028a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/048028a0","description":"ONCE last winter on entering the laboratory here after it had been shut up for a few days, we found the floor, tables, shelves, window-ledges, and even dishes on the highest shelves, covered with great numbers of dead amphipods.

I must continue to insist, as I have done heretofore in the columns of NATURE and elsewhere, that the study of the periodicity of magnetic storms and auroras at intervals of about twenty-seven and one quarter days must precede that of the attendant solar conditions, otherwise no results will be obtained. For example, during the month of August 1893, to which the note above mentioned refers, sun-spots were so numerous that it would be utterly impossible to determine which group, if any, were in a location upon the sun capable of originating terrestrial magnetic effects. The proper way is to begin by disregarding solar conditions entirely, and arrange the magnetic storms or auroras of the period that it is desired to study, in series as they actually occurred at the twenty-seven and one quarter day interval. This being done, it is possible at a glance to determine what particular solar conditions reappear invariably when magnetic perturbations are recorded. In this way, and in this way alone, it becomes evident that whenever these magnetic effects appear, there is always a disturbed portion of the sun at the eastern limb and near the plane of the earth's orbit in that location. If the series of recurrences is sufficiently persistent to last through many solar rotations, it will be found that the disturbed area continues to have its effect in spite of considerable variations in the size of the spots, and that at times these effects may continue even when nothing but groups of facul\u00e6 remain, these being however, unusually bright and extensive in such a case. By following the history of such recurrences into the portion of the year in which any given disturbed portion of the sun is at a distance from the plane of the earth's orbit, when at the eastern limb, it is found that outbreaks of violent thunderstorms, which do not produce any disturbance of the magnetic needle, take the place of magnetic storms and auroras in the regular order of recurrence. There have been some phenomenal illustrations of this the past winter. Usually in this part of the United States a thunderstorm in winter is very rare, and, if it occurs, stands forth as a prominent event. Thus the thunderstorms of Christmas-day and night, in which buildings were struck by lightning in this State, were most exceptional, and, falling as they did upon the proper date to form the continuation of the strongest and most persistent series of thunder storms and auroras that has been current the past year, were most striking. The above method of attacking the question is that which the writer has gradually developed for the purpose of systematic study. The relation having once been established by tracing the history faithfully and in detail, in the manner described, it is no longer absolutely essential to enter into the question of periodicity in order to secure evidence bearing upon the question. As soon as it is known what has to be looked for, it will only be necessary, when any very large increase of thunder storms occurs, or any notable magnetic perturbations, as the case may be, to look at the proper part of the sun, and see whether it is the seat of disturbance. In this way it will be found that it is not the size of solar disturbances, but their activity at the critical date when they are in the proper location, that determines the terrestrial effects to which reference has been made.

Kais. Gesellsch. der Wiss. G\u00f6ttingen, 1894, No. 2), as was shown by Dr. G\u00fcnther in commenting upon them before the Zoological Society on the 3rd inst. Dr. G\u00fcnther advanced good reason for regarding the villi as sexual and confined to the male, as is implied in Prof. Lankester's letter. A specimen of a fine male has recently come into my hands, in which, in contradistinction to all others yet described in print, the \u201danus\u201d (cloacal aperture) is located to the right of the median ventral fin; and it is thus proved that Lepidosiren, like Protopterus, is individually variable in the inter-relationship of these two parts of its body. Being aware that Brock had recently described the histological structure of dendritic processes occurring in the neighbourhood of the genital orifice, in the male of Plotosus (Copidoglanis) anguillaris and in the two sexes of Gasterotokeus biaculeatus, I requested my pupil Mr. J.

Kais. Gesellsch. der Wiss. G\u00f6ttingen, 1894, No. 2), as was shown by Dr. G\u00fcnther in commenting upon them before the Zoological Society on the 3rd inst. Dr. G\u00fcnther advanced good reason for regarding the villi as sexual and confined to the male, as is implied in Prof. Lankester's letter. A specimen of a fine male has recently come into my hands, in which, in contradistinction to all others yet described in print, the \u201danus\u201d (cloacal aperture) is located to the right of the median ventral fin; and it is thus proved that Lepidosiren, like Protopterus, is individually variable in the inter-relationship of these two parts of its body. Being aware that Brock had recently described the histological structure of dendritic processes occurring in the neighbourhood of the genital orifice, in the male of Plotosus (Copidoglanis) anguillaris and in the two sexes of Gasterotokeus biaculeatus, I requested my pupil Mr. J. Sumner to make sections of those of Lepidosiren, hoping that erectile tissue and tactile organs, such as Brock describes, might have been present. We can find neither. The villi are highly vascular and non-muscular. Dr, Bohls, who captured the specimens that have lately reached Europe, has signified his intention of working out these structures in full; and it is fair to him to assume that he is in possession of material specially prepared for the purpose.","dc.creator":["HOWES, G.

In the first place, I would point out that in making the statements referred to by Mr. Scudder, I did so with the full cognisance of the late Dr. Angus Smith's work as published by him in his second Report to the Local Government Board, and in an article of his which appeared in the Sanitary Record in 1883. In this work I was so much interested that I at once, in the same year, set about applying the method described by Dr. Angus Smith to a number of the samples of London and other waters which were being subjected to analysis in my private house at the time.

In the first place, I would point out that in making the statements referred to by Mr. Scudder, I did so with the full cognisance of the late Dr. Angus Smith's work as published by him in his second Report to the Local Government Board, and in an article of his which appeared in the Sanitary Record in 1883. In this work I was so much interested that I at once, in the same year, set about applying the method described by Dr. Angus Smith to a number of the samples of London and other waters which were being subjected to analysis in my private house at the time. These experiments yielded, however, such indefinite and unintelligible results that I entirely abandoned Dr. Smith's process, and it was not until the summer of the following year (1884) that I became really acquainted with Koch's method of plate-cultivating bacteria through the now classical demonstrations given by Mr. Watson Cheyne at the Health Exhibition.

Smolan (NATURE, March 25), on the influence of R\u00f6ntgen rays on electric conduction through air, paraffin, and glass, in which the authors state that they cannot detect any influence of R\u00f6ntgen radiation on conduction through solids. I think that the difference between this result and the one obtained by Mr. McClelland and myself arises from the temporary character of the effect of the radiation on solids. The increase in the conductivity of solids is only appreciable for a short time after the application of the electric force (see NATURE, July 30, 1896, p. 306); under long-continued electromotive forces the conductivity seems unaffected by the rays. The effect might perhaps be more accurrately described as an increase in the electric absorption, rather than as an increase in conductivity. I have been for the past few months engaged in experiments on the effect of the rays on solids and liquids, particularly liquids; and, though the experiments have been much interrupted by the pressure of other work, I hope soon to have them ready for publication. There is one experiment, however, which may be of interest. Of all the liquids tried, that sold as vaseline oil has proved the best insulator; in its pure state it is very transparent to R\u00f6ntgen rays, so to increase the absorption of these rays I stained the oil with iodine, when it became very opaque to them. The oil does not insulate so well after staining as it did before, but the effect of a slight amount of conductivity is not of importance when the following method is used. Three electrodes, A, B, C, are placed in a leaden vessel filled with the oil. B, which is between A and C, is connected to one pair of quadrants of an electrometer, A and C to the terminals of a battery of 1000 small storage cells. If there is any leakage the potential of B will, in general, not remain zero after the battery is put on, but it will do so if an earth connection is made at the proper place in the battery.

Smolan (NATURE, March 25), on the influence of R\u00f6ntgen rays on electric conduction through air, paraffin, and glass, in which the authors state that they cannot detect any influence of R\u00f6ntgen radiation on conduction through solids. I think that the difference between this result and the one obtained by Mr. McClelland and myself arises from the temporary character of the effect of the radiation on solids. The increase in the conductivity of solids is only appreciable for a short time after the application of the electric force (see NATURE, July 30, 1896, p. 306); under long-continued electromotive forces the conductivity seems unaffected by the rays. The effect might perhaps be more accurrately described as an increase in the electric absorption, rather than as an increase in conductivity. I have been for the past few months engaged in experiments on the effect of the rays on solids and liquids, particularly liquids; and, though the experiments have been much interrupted by the pressure of other work, I hope soon to have them ready for publication. There is one experiment, however, which may be of interest. Of all the liquids tried, that sold as vaseline oil has proved the best insulator; in its pure state it is very transparent to R\u00f6ntgen rays, so to increase the absorption of these rays I stained the oil with iodine, when it became very opaque to them. The oil does not insulate so well after staining as it did before, but the effect of a slight amount of conductivity is not of importance when the following method is used. Three electrodes, A, B, C, are placed in a leaden vessel filled with the oil. B, which is between A and C, is connected to one pair of quadrants of an electrometer, A and C to the terminals of a battery of 1000 small storage cells. If there is any leakage the potential of B will, in general, not remain zero after the battery is put on, but it will do so if an earth connection is made at the proper place in the battery. The base of the vessel below B C was cut out, and an aluminium vessel inserted, so that the liquid between B and C could be exposed to the R\u00f6ntgen rays. A balance was obtained with the rays off; when the rays were turned on, the potential of B no longer remained zero, but changed in the way it would if the conductivity between B and C had increased. This effect was small but well marked, and seemed to last however long the electromotive force was kept on.","dc.creator":["THOMSON, J.

It is true that we have very few remaining beds of gravel or sand, and in those, as yet, no mollusca have been discovered.

Heretics have long learned not to expect mercy, or even to look for justice, at the hands of the orthodox.

Alexander in NATURE of January 19, is a particular case of a more general theorem which I have not seen stated, though very likely it is not new. The well-known theorem of couches de glissement. is also a case of it. Imagine two spheres, one of radius r and made of positive or attracting matter of density \u03c3, the other of radius \u0155 and made of negative or repelling matter of the same density \u03c3, to coexist even if they overlap.

Imagine two spheres, one of radius r and made of positive or attracting matter of density \u03c3, the other of radius \u0155 and made of negative or repelling matter of the same density \u03c3, to coexist even if they overlap.

Dr. Macfadyen suggests that since phosphorescent bacteria regain their power of emitting light after being cooled to the temperature of liquid hydrogen, it may be the case that life is not dependent for its existence on chemical reactions. Because, says he, at the temperature of liquid hydrogen, e.g. \u2013250\u00b0C., all chemical reactions are well-nigh, if not absolutely, at a standstill, if life were dependent on chemical reactions for its continuance, at that low temperature life would be destroyed.

Dr. Macfadyen suggests that since phosphorescent bacteria regain their power of emitting light after being cooled to the temperature of liquid hydrogen, it may be the case that life is not dependent for its existence on chemical reactions. Because, says he, at the temperature of liquid hydrogen, e.g. \u2013250\u00b0C., all chemical reactions are well-nigh, if not absolutely, at a standstill, if life were dependent on chemical reactions for its continuance, at that low temperature life would be destroyed. I would submit that this is a case of non sequitur. It appears exceedingly probable that the action of excessive cold in suspending and stopping vital phenomena, while not destroying the capacity of organisms to resume their vital activities, supports the prevalent view that life is dependent on chemical processes. For may it not be that excessive cold, while preventing the vital processes from taking place, by no means alters the chemical constitution of the complicated molecules, the interactions of which normally produce vital phenomena, and leave these molecules, which one may call biogens or anything else, in exactly the same state as they were immediately before the onset of excessive cold, ready as soon as the conditions become suitable once more to resume those vital processes which are known as metabolism.","dc.creator":["D., H.

Other languages have, from time to time, reformed their spelling so as to bring it more into harmony with the pronunciation, and this has been the case in our own time with German. It can scarcely be doubted that, sooner or later, the same will be the case with English.

C. Ewart's admirable paper on \u201cThe Multiple Origin of Horses and Ponies\u201d suggests a few remarks. The paper in question is from the Transactions of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, 1904\u2014one could wish that it had appeared in a publication which comes more regularly under the notice of zoologists. In a previous paper (Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh, 1903) Prof. Ewart had shown conclusively that Equus prjevalskii was not a hybrid between the kiang and the common horse, and had arrived at the conclusion that it might very well rank as a valid species. Lydekker in 1902 had proposed to regard E. prjevalskii (or przewalskii) as a subspecies of E. caballus, and now Prof. Ewart does the same, while recognising also two other subspecies, E. c. typicus and E. c. celticus. The animal named typicus is the Norse horse, which is arbitrarily selected as the type of the Linnean caballus.

C. Ewart's admirable paper on \u201cThe Multiple Origin of Horses and Ponies\u201d suggests a few remarks. The paper in question is from the Transactions of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, 1904\u2014one could wish that it had appeared in a publication which comes more regularly under the notice of zoologists. In a previous paper (Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh, 1903) Prof. Ewart had shown conclusively that Equus prjevalskii was not a hybrid between the kiang and the common horse, and had arrived at the conclusion that it might very well rank as a valid species. Lydekker in 1902 had proposed to regard E. prjevalskii (or przewalskii) as a subspecies of E. caballus, and now Prof. Ewart does the same, while recognising also two other subspecies, E. c. typicus and E. c. celticus. The animal named typicus is the Norse horse, which is arbitrarily selected as the type of the Linnean caballus. The Celtic pony, still surviving in the pure state in Iceland, is given the new name E. c. celticus. In its way, Prof. Ewart's demonstration of the distinctive characters of this animal deserves to rank with Darwin's treatise on the primrose, as an example of genius applied to common things. The case is so clear that the author himself is evidently half inclined to regard the Celtic pony as a valid species, and it seems to me that the facts justify us in recognising three species of living horses, E. prjevalskii (Poliakoff), E. celticus (Ewart) and E. caballus (L.).

I have lately had occasion to consider the problem again, and perhaps I may be allowed to re-state my argument in a slightly altered form, and illustrate it by means of an imaginary model.","dc.creator":["BIDWELL, SHELFORD"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["BIDWELL, SHELFORD"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Stress in Magnetised Iron","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Stress in Magnetised Iron&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"074443a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

S. Russell describes the result of a determination of the amount of radium in a specimen of autunite from Autun, France, made by him in Prof. Marckwald's laboratory, which he found to be only 27 per cent. of the equilibrium amount.

There is no danger from a bomb dropped by one of these vessels unless the latter is approaching the zenith, and will reach there in a few seconds. If the Zeppelin appears inclined\u2014that is, unless one end appears exactly over the other\u2014there is no danger. This is easily seen at a glance, but a plumb-line formed by a stone attached to a string will show this with certainty. The Zeppelin will always pass on the side towards which the upper end points. If, however, it is vertical, and near the zenith, there is great danger. If its altitude is, for example, a mile, a bomb dropped would occupy 18 seconds in falling, if there were no air. Owing to the resistance of the latter, this time is greatly increased. It is only necessary to run at right angles to the apparent direction of the Zeppelin to be safe, even if one does not start until the bomb is dropped. This rule may be tested by standing under a telephone wire, which may be regarded as representing the path of the Zeppelin. A plumb-line will cover the wire only if the observer is exactly under the wire. No allowance is here made for the wind, which always carries the Zeppelin to leeward. It may be better, therefore, to stand so that the Zeppelin is partially covered by the edge of a house, a flagpole, or other vertical line. There is no danger unless the Zeppelin appears to ascend the line, remaining partially covered as it approaches the zenith. The same principles apply to aeroplanes. At sea, the vessel should take a course at right angles to the direction from which the Zeppelin comes. Of course, these methods are useless if the Zeppelin cannot be seen owing to clouds or darkness, unless it is picked up by a searchlight.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"97","prism.number":"2428","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"221","prism.endingPage":"222","prism.copyright":"1916 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/097221b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/097221b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/097221b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/097221b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Avoiding Zeppelins","citation_volume":"97","citation_issue":"2428","citation_publication_date":"1916/05","citation_firstpage":"221","citation_lastpage":"222","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/097221b0","DOI":"10.1038/097221b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/097221b0","description":"A LITTLE knowledge of spherical perspective would materially reduce the loss of life due to Zeppelins.

If, however, it is vertical, and near the zenith, there is great danger. If its altitude is, for example, a mile, a bomb dropped would occupy 18 seconds in falling, if there were no air. Owing to the resistance of the latter, this time is greatly increased. It is only necessary to run at right angles to the apparent direction of the Zeppelin to be safe, even if one does not start until the bomb is dropped. This rule may be tested by standing under a telephone wire, which may be regarded as representing the path of the Zeppelin. A plumb-line will cover the wire only if the observer is exactly under the wire. No allowance is here made for the wind, which always carries the Zeppelin to leeward. It may be better, therefore, to stand so that the Zeppelin is partially covered by the edge of a house, a flagpole, or other vertical line. There is no danger unless the Zeppelin appears to ascend the line, remaining partially covered as it approaches the zenith. The same principles apply to aeroplanes. At sea, the vessel should take a course at right angles to the direction from which the Zeppelin comes. Of course, these methods are useless if the Zeppelin cannot be seen owing to clouds or darkness, unless it is picked up by a searchlight.","dc.creator":["PICKERING, E.

Optical2,3 and infrared4 images of \u03b2 Pic suggest that the disk is composed of dust grains which have been interpreted1 as the debris generated by the disruption of the asteroid-sized remnants of planet-formation processes5. The star itself is relatively old, with an age in excess of 100 Myr. Here we present high-resolution millimetre-wave images of continuum and molecular-line emission from dust and gas surrounding a much younger star, MWC480: the stellar properties of MWC480 are similar to those of \u03b2 Pic, but its age is just 6 Myr.

Optical2,3 and infrared4 images of \u03b2 Pic suggest that the disk is composed of dust grains which have been interpreted1 as the debris generated by the disruption of the asteroid-sized remnants of planet-formation processes5. The star itself is relatively old, with an age in excess of 100 Myr. Here we present high-resolution millimetre-wave images of continuum and molecular-line emission from dust and gas surrounding a much younger star, MWC480: the stellar properties of MWC480 are similar to those of \u03b2 Pic, but its age is just 6 Myr. The morphology of the circumstellar material and a comparison with the predictions of kinematic modelling indicate the presence of a rotating disk, gravitationally bound to the star. Moreover, the mass of the disk is greater than the minimum required to form a planetary system like our own5.

Such an approach would normally form dendritic or powdery deposits, but we identify a range of conditions in which uniform films rapidly form.","dc.creator":["Fleury, Vincent","Watters, Wesley A.","Allam, Levy","Devers, Thierry"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_title=Electrodeposition; citation_publication_date=1992; citation_id=CR1; citation_author=J Dini","citation_title=Mundus Subterraneus, Caput VI, liber duodecimus part I; citation_publication_date=1664; citation_id=CR2; citation_author=A Kircher","citation_title=China Monumentis qua Sacris qua Profanis, nec non Variis Naturae et Artis Spectaculis Aliarumque Rerim Meomriabilium Argumentis Illustrata; citation_publication_date=1667; citation_id=CR3; citation_author=A Kircher","citation_title=Science and Civilization in China; citation_publication_date=1984; citation_id=CR4; citation_author=J Needham; citation_author=H Peng Yoke","citation_title=Arbres de Pierre, La Croissance Fractale de la Mati\u00e8re; citation_publication_date=1998; citation_id=CR5; citation_author=V Fleury","Fleury, V.

It is a potent biological mediator that modulates the activity of numerous cell types, including various neuronal populations, platelets, neutrophils and mast cells, and smooth muscle cells in bronchi and vasculature.

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa continues to grow at an alarming rate, with 3.5 million people infected last year alone1. It has recently been proposed that heterosexual transmission cannot account for more than 35% of HIV incidence in this region, and that parenteral transmission, probably through unsterile medical practices, is the main route of infection2.

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa continues to grow at an alarming rate, with 3.5 million people infected last year alone1. It has recently been proposed that heterosexual transmission cannot account for more than 35% of HIV incidence in this region, and that parenteral transmission, probably through unsterile medical practices, is the main route of infection2. A key prediction of this hypothesis is that the epidemic history of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa is similar to that of other blood-borne pathogens. To test this, we compared prevalence estimates of HIV with those of hepatitis C virus (HCV), which has a far greater rate of parenteral than sexual transmission.

They impart their own salty taste and enhance other flavours.

Toxins called cytotoxic necrotizing factors (CNFs) are among the virulence factors produced by uropathogenic (CNF1)1 or enteropathogenic (CNF2)2 E. coli strains that cause diseases in humans and animals, respectively. CNFs induce an increase in the content of actin stress fibres and focal contacts in cultured cells3,4. Effects of CNFs on the actin cytoskeleton correlated with a decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of the GTP-binding protein Rho4,5 and indirect evidence indicates that CNF1 might constitutively activate Rho6. Here we show that CNF1 catalyses the deamidation of a glutamine residue at position 63 of Rho, turning it into glutamic acid, which inhibits both intrinsic GTP hydrolysis and that stimulated by its GTPase-activating protein (GAP).

Toxins called cytotoxic necrotizing factors (CNFs) are among the virulence factors produced by uropathogenic (CNF1)1 or enteropathogenic (CNF2)2 E. coli strains that cause diseases in humans and animals, respectively. CNFs induce an increase in the content of actin stress fibres and focal contacts in cultured cells3,4.

Laboratory experiments on granular material under pressure suggest that triggering is a result of seismic waves impinging on a fault and inducing elastic nonlinear behaviour of the fault core, accompanied by instantaneous weakening and failure. The resulting \u2018softening-to-weakening\u2019 model fits in well with field observations of real earthquakes. After an earthquake, numerous smaller shocks are triggered over distances comparable to the dimensions of the mainshock fault rupture, although they are rare at larger distances. Here we analyse the scaling of dynamic deformations (the stresses and strains associated with seismic waves) with distance from, and magnitude of, their triggering earthquake, and show that they can cause further earthquakes at any distance if their amplitude exceeds several microstrain, regardless of their frequency content.

The resulting \u2018softening-to-weakening\u2019 model fits in well with field observations of real earthquakes. After an earthquake, numerous smaller shocks are triggered over distances comparable to the dimensions of the mainshock fault rupture, although they are rare at larger distances. Here we analyse the scaling of dynamic deformations (the stresses and strains associated with seismic waves) with distance from, and magnitude of, their triggering earthquake, and show that they can cause further earthquakes at any distance if their amplitude exceeds several microstrain, regardless of their frequency content. These triggering requirements are remarkably similar to those measured in the laboratory for inducing dynamic elastic nonlinear behaviour, which suggests that the underlying physics is similar1,2.","dc.creator":["Gomberg, Joan","Johnson, Paul"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_author=PA Johnson, X Jia; citation_volume=437; citation_publication_date=2005; citation_pages=871-874; citation_doi=10.1038/nature04015; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Physics Today; citation_author=RA Guyer, PA Johnson; citation_volume=52; citation_publication_date=1999; citation_pages=30-35; citation_doi=10.1063/1.882648; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Bull.

The goal of this chapter is to elucidate some of those questions and suggest new directions for this area of research.","dc.creator":["Levine, A J","Hu, W","Feng, Z"],"dc.subject":["Life Sciences, general","Biochemistry, general","Cell Biology","Stem Cells","Apoptosis","Cell Cycle Analysis"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=T antigen is bound to a host protein in SV40-transformed cells; citation_author=DP Lane, LV Crawford; citation_volume=278; citation_publication_date=1979; citation_pages=261-263; citation_doi=10.1038/278261a0; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Cell; citation_title=Characterization of a 54\u2009K dalton cellular SV40 tumor antigen present in SV40-transformed cells and uninfected embryonal carcinoma cells; citation_author=DI Linzer, AJ Levine; citation_volume=17; citation_publication_date=1979; citation_pages=43-52; citation_doi=10.1016/0092-8674(79)90293-9; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=J.

For example, catalytic methane combustion, which generates power with reduced greenhouse-gas and nitrogen-oxide emissions1,2,3, is limited by the availability of catalysts that are sufficiently active at low temperatures for start-up and are then able to sustain activity and mechanical integrity at flame temperatures as high as 1,300\u2009\u00b0C. Here we use sol\u2013gel processing in reverse microemulsions to produce discrete barium hexaaluminate nanoparticles that display excellent methane combustion activity, owing to their high surface area, high thermal stability and the ultrahigh dispersion of cerium oxide on the their surfaces. Our synthesis method provides a general route to the production of a wide range of thermally stable nanostructured composite materials with large surface-to-volume ratios4,5,6 and an ultrahigh component dispersion that gives rise to synergistic chemical and electronic effects7,8, thus paving the way to the development of catalysts suitable for high-temperature industrial applications.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"403","prism.number":"6765","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"65","prism.endingPage":"67","prism.copyright":"2000 Macmillan Magazines Ltd.","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/47450","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/47450","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/47450.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/47450","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Reverse microemulsion synthesis of nanostructured complex oxides for catalytic combustion","citation_volume":"403","citation_issue":"6765","citation_publication_date":"2000/01","citation_firstpage":"65","citation_lastpage":"67","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/47450","DOI":"10.1038/47450","citation_doi":"10.1038/47450","description":"Catalysts play an important role in many industrial processes, but their use in high-temperature applications\u2014such as energy generation through natural gas combustion, steam reforming and the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons to produce feedstock chemicals\u2014is problematic.

LEDs have several advantages over incandescent lamps, including energy efficiency, robustness, long lifetime, and good temporal stability. The three latter features make LEDs attractive candidates as new photometric standards. Because the spectra of white LEDs are limited to the visible wavelength range, a novel method for the realization of photometric units based on the predictable quantum efficient detector (PQED) can be utilized. The method eliminates the need of photometric filters that are traditionally used in photometry, and instead relies on carrying out the photometric weighting numerically based on the measured relative spectrum of the source. The PQED-based realization simplifies the traceability chain of photometric measurements significantly as compared with the traditional filter-based method. The measured illuminance values of a white LED deviate by only 0.03% when determined by the new and the traditional methods. The new PQED method has significantly lower expanded uncertainty of 0.26% (k = 2) as compared with that of the traditional filter-based method of 0.42% (k = 2). Furthermore, when filtered photometers that measure LED lighting are calibrated using LED lamps as calibration sources instead of incandescent lamps, a significant decrease in the uncertainty related to the spectral mismatch correction can be obtained. The maximum spectral mismatch errors of LED measurements decreased on average by a factor of 3 when switching from an incandescent lamp to an LED calibration source. White light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can be used to define photometric units and offer several advantages over conventional incandescent lamps. Tungsten-filament incandescent lamps are widely used as standard light sources in photometry, but LEDs have higher energy efficiencies, greater robustness, long lifetimes, and good temporal stability. Now, a team of scientists in Finland has demonstrated that a high accuracy can be achieved by using a new primary standard for optical power based on an induced junction photodiode trap as a broadband detector. By measuring the illuminance of a white LED lamp, they show that this detector is more accurate than photometers when LEDs are used as the light source. Furthermore, using LEDs does not require filters as photometric weighting is performed numerically based on the measured relative spectrum of the source.","prism.publicationName":"Light: Science & Applications","prism.publicationDate":"2015-09-11","prism.volume":"4","prism.number":"9","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"e332","prism.endingPage":"e332","prism.copyright":"2015 The Author(s)","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa2015105","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2015.105","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa2015105.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa2015105","citation_journal_title":"Light: Science & Applications","citation_journal_abbrev":"Light Sci Appl","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"2047-7538","citation_title":"Advantages of white LED lamps and new detector technology in photometry","citation_volume":"4","citation_issue":"9","citation_publication_date":"2015/09","citation_online_date":"2015/09/11","citation_firstpage":"e332","citation_lastpage":"e332","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2015.105","DOI":"10.1038/lsa.2015.105","citation_doi":"10.1038/lsa.2015.105","description":"Light emitting diode (LED) lighting is becoming more and more popular, as incandescent lamps are being phased out globally.

The samples are illuminated by a nearly coherent illumination system, where the hologram shadows are projected into a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor-based imaging sensor. To increase the resolution, a multi-frame pixel resolution approach is employed to produce a single holographic image from multiple frame observations of the scene, with small planar displacements. Displacements are resolved by a hybrid approach: (i) alignment of the LR images by a fast feature-based registration method, and (ii) fine adjustment of the sub-pixel information using a continuous optimization approach designed to find the global optimum solution. Numerical method for phase-retrieval is applied to decode the signal and reconstruct the morphological details of the analyzed sample. The presented approach was evaluated with various biological samples including sperm and platelets, whose dimensions are in the order of a few microns. The obtained results demonstrate a spatial resolution of 1.55 \u03bcm on a field-of-view of \u224830 mm2.
