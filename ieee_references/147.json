As we use the terms, small-signal instabilities are those instabilities predicted by equations of motion linearized about a stationary (time-independent, but not necessarily spatially-uniform) solution of the dynamic equations. Under conditions of small-signal instability the amplitude of an arbitrarily small perturbation of the stationary system gradually grows to a limiting amplitude determined by nonlinear saturation mechanisms. Although the limiting signal may be of \"large\" amplitude, we wish to distinguish these instabilities from the intrinsically large-amplitude instabilities which are characterized by a minimum signal amplitude and which cannot even approximately be described by linearized equations of motion. Systems which are large-signal unstable but small-signal stable will return to a stable time-independent configuration if a disturbing perturbation is less than a critical minimum value. If a perturbation exceeds this critical value, the system will not return to the time-independent configuration but will approach a phase-space trajectory appropriate to cyclic steady-state operation. In systems which are both small-signal and large-signal unstable, it is usually, but not always, true that small-signal instabilities grow to amplitudes characteristic of the large-signal instability.","context":[],"refType":"biblio","id":"ref14"},{"order":"16","text":"P.
